    "pubDate": "2024-10-14T21:21:54.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "This paper presents a novel approach for mitigating wormhole attacks on wireless networks using propagation delay timing. The wormhole attack is a persistent security threat that threatens the integrity of network communications, potentially leading to data theft or other malicious activities. While various methods exist for combating wormhole attacks, our approach offers advantages that set it apart. Our approach involves a combination of proactive and reactive measures, harnessing box plot analysis and weighting factor techniques to identify and isolate outlier node links effectively. Unlike traditional methods, our solution not only detects outlier links but also defines dynamic weighting factors, providing a more adaptive response to network anomalies. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, testing was conducted using a custom-built testbed running on an external network simulator. The results demonstrate that our proposed technique identifies outlier links, defines appropriate weighting factors, and isolates questionable links. Compared to existing methodologies, our approach exhibits better performance with easier installation and lower overhead while adapting to evolving attack strategies. In conclusion, this paper presents a practical and highly effective solution for mitigating wormhole attacks in wireless networks, distinguishing itself through its adaptability to changing networks while maintaining ease of installation and low overhead."

    "pubDate": "2024-10-07T20:34:00.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "Engagement is a critical part of student learning and student success. This is especially true in online classes where students have less interaction with their classmates and instructors when compared to traditional face-to-face courses. Research on engagement has shown that when students are meaningfully engaged it can increase student satisfaction and it may also increase levels of academic achievement, including grades earned and degree progression (e.g. Wong et al., 2024). This paper focuses on social engagement in a graduate cybersecurity program that uses large, expandable online courses as described by Whitman and Mattord (2023). Large online graduate classes (i.e., more than 35 students in one class) present a new challenge to educators who are traditionally accustomed to teaching graduate classes with much smaller enrollment. To help faculty meaningfully engage students in large online classes, this paper presents three strategies for faculty to synchronously connect with students in an asynchronous class: welcome events, drop-in sessions, and happy hours. Finally, this paper will also report the results from a survey administered to cybersecurity students in a large online class to measure their perceptions of engagement."

    "pubDate": "2024-09-23T18:41:47.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "Cybersecurity threats have been a serious and growing problem for decades. In addition, a severe shortage of cybersecurity professionals has been proliferating for nearly as long. These problems exist in the United States and globally and are well documented in literature. This study examined what state universities are doing to help address the shortage of cybersecurity professionals since higher education institutions are a primary source to the workforce pipeline. It is suggested that the number of cybersecurity professionals entering the workforce is related to the number of available programs. Thus increasing the number of programs will increase the number of cybersecurity professionals entering the workforce. This study used a qualitative approach to examine the programs offered through a sample of 201 state universities using a document review of online academic catalogs. The research examined the quantities and levels of cybersecurity programs and identified the institutions that used the National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) structure to develop their programs. The results showed that an impressive 84.6% of the universities sampled offered a cybersecurity program and of which more than 50% received a CAE designation. Although the results were impressive, there are still unanswered questions requiring further study in regards to having a satisfactory number of programs to generate the needed talent to reduce the shortage. This study generated several important questions and recommendations and highlighted the availability of cybersecurity programs at the state university level at a snapshot in time. The results can be used to help identify any additional academic needs to help address the shortage of cybersecurity professionals."

    "contentSnippet": "Detecting and mitigating wormhole attacks in wireless networks remains a critical challenge due to their deceptive nature and potential to compromise network integrity. This paper proposes a novel approach to wormhole detection by leveraging propagation delay analysis between network nodes. Unlike traditional methods that rely on signature-based detection or specialized hardware, our method focuses on analyzing propagation delay timings to identify anomalous behavior indicative of wormhole attacks. The proposed methodology involves collecting propagation delay data in both normal network scenarios and scenarios with inserted malicious wormhole nodes. By comparing these delay timings, our approach aims to differentiate between legitimate network paths and potential wormhole shortcuts. Utilizing the NS-3 network simulator, we validate the effectiveness of our method in accurately detecting and mitigating wormhole attacks. The key advantage of our approach lies in its proactive nature and ability to detect wormholes without relying on specific attack signatures or additional hardware. Using the consistency of propagation delay data, our method offers a promising avenue for early detection and prevention of wormhole attacks, thereby enhancing network security and reliability.

Many students struggle to focus on schoolwork, due to a lack of interest, lack of understanding, or other factors unique to the student. Applying gamification elements to education can help engage these students in learning their course material and help them excel academically. This study examines the effectiveness of using gamification techniques to enhance the learning experience in college Computer Science courses. A video game application is utilized to review and reinforce cybersecurity concepts that students have already been taught in class. Previous work has been made on a prototype game build that teaches about ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) components. The focus of this study is to refine and develop the structure of the prototype into a more interactive and enjoyable format with non-competitive and captivating activities that allow students to study at their own pace. An updated version of the game was created that focused on reaching a balance between education and entertainment. The game was used by students enrolled in a cybersecurity class, where pre-survey, post-survey and a focus group interview were conducted to determine how effective the updated version is compared to the current build, in addition to how effective the gamification method is regarding student retention of taught material. The pre-survey and post-survey results revealed an increase in interest and mastery of cybersecurity concepts as a result of playing the game. Students found value in the game as both a method of reviewing material taught in class and an entertaining and engaging game. These results show potential in using gamification in cybersecurity and education."

    "contentSnippet": "The cybersecurity threat landscape evolves quickly, continually, and consequentially. This means that the transfer of cybersecurity learning is crucial. We compared how different recognized “cognitive” transfer theories might help explain and synergize three aspects of cybersecurity education. These include teaching and training in diverse settings, assessing learning formatively & summatively, and testing & measuring achievement, proficiency, & readiness. We excluded newer sociocultural theories and their implications for inclusion as we explore those theories elsewhere. We first summarized the history of cybersecurity education and proficiency standards considering transfer theories. We then explored each theory and reviewed the most relevant cybersecurity education research; in some cases, we broadened our search to computing education. We concluded that (a) archaic differential transfer theories are still influential but have negative implications to be avoided, (b) constructionist theories are popular in K-12 settings but raise issues for assessment and transfer, (c) many embrace a general cognitive science perspective that can resolve tensions between modern cognitive-associationist and cognitive-constructivist theories that are popular with innovators, and (d) new perceptual and coordinative theories have potential worth exploring. These insights should support “generative” cybersecurity learning that transfers readily and widely to future classes, tests, and workplaces. These insights should be beneficial when designing and using cyber “ranges” and other hyper-realistic simulations, where transfer assumptions inform costly design decisions and undergird the validity of performance as evidence of proficiency."

    "pubDate": "2023-12-18T18:36:48.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "Data transfer between isolated clusters is imperative for cybersecurity education, research, and testing. Such techniques facilitate hands-on cybersecurity learning in isolated clusters, allow cybersecurity students to practice with various hacking tools, and develop professional cybersecurity technical skills. Educators often use these remote learning environments for research as well. Researchers and students use these isolated environments to test sophisticated hardware, software, and procedures using full-fledged operating systems, networks, and applications. Virus and malware researchers may wish to release suspected malicious software in a controlled environment to observe their behavior better or gain the information needed to assist their reverse engineering processes. The isolation prevents harm to networked systems. However, there are times when the data is required to move in such quantities or speeds that it makes downloading onto an intermediate device untenable. This study proposes a novel turnstile model, a mechanism for one-way file transfer from one enterprise system to another without allowing data leakage. This system protects data integrity and security by connecting the isolated environment to the external network via a locked-down interconnection. Using medium-security isolated clusters, the researchers successfully developed a unidirectional file transfer system that acts as a one-way “turnstile” for secure file transfer between systems not connected to the internet or other external networks. The Turnstile system (source code available at github.com/monnin/turnstile) provides unidirectional file transfer between two computer systems. The solution enabled data to be transferred from a source system to a destination system without allowing any data to be transferred back in the opposite direction. The researchers found an automated process of transferring external files to isolated clusters optimized the transfer speed of external files to isolated clusters using Linux distributions and commands."

    "contentSnippet": "Aims: Regardless of literature citing the effectiveness of trauma-informed care (TIC) (e.g., Capezza & Najavits, 2012; Covington, 2008; Morgan et al., 2020), implementation is lacking in settings that serve women with substance use disorders (SUD) (Bartholow & Huffman, 2023; Capezza & Najavits, 2012; Terplan et al., 2015). Not implementing TIC often results in methods that are trauma-inducing, may prevent the achievement desired outcomes, and lead to negative outcomes such as drop-out and relapse (Brown et al., 2013; Capezza & Najavits, 2012; Claus & Kindleberger, 2002; Hales et al., 2019; SAMHSA, 2014). This study aims to provide a theoretically driven empirical model that can measure and explain clinicians’ behavioral intentions surrounding the use of trauma-informed care in women’s substance use disorder treatment. This exploratory, quantitative, correlational, nonexperimental study seeks to determine which factors predict an intention to use a trauma-informed approach with women in SUD treatment. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is a psychological theory that explains how a person’s beliefs and intentions influence their behavior. The TPB posits that one’s attitude towards the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence behavioral intention. The researcher examined how well TPB predicts clinicians’ intention to use a trauma-informed approach to care. One goal of the research is to advance the understanding of what leads an SUD treatment provider to use a trauma-informed approach, which in turn may influence the development of additional training and policies that will increase the use of TIC in women’s SUD treatment (an empirically supported intervention). Methodology: The sample consisted of 490 current professional members/affiliates of The Association for Addiction Professionals (NAADAC), who responded to a recruitment email by completing an online survey through Qualtrics. The study used multiple linear regression to examine the relationships between TPB variables (IVs) and intention to use TIC (DV). An additional multiple linear regression model was used to determine which demographic variables were associated with clinicians’ intention to use TIC. Findings: The TPB was supported by the data. The TPB alone (not controlling for demographic influences) explained 69.1% of the variance in clinicians’ intention to use TIC in women’s SUD treatment. The final multiple linear regression model that included TPB variables and demographic controls explained 74.0% variance in clinicians’ intention to use TIC. Male clinicians and those who completed some college were significantly less likely to use TIC with women in SUD treatment. An individual’s perceived behavioral control was found to be the strongest predictor of intention in both models. Conclusions: The findings cast light on the multiple factors that impact a clinician’s use of TIC with women in SUD treatment. First, a clinician’s perspective about their control over, or ability to use the intervention in a given service setting significantly predicted whether they intended to use (or were already using) a trauma-informed approach to treatment. Second, the perceived social pressure to engage or not to engage in using TIC in one’s agency similarly predicted the use of TIC (revealing the power of an organization and colleagues to influence clinician behavior). Third, the degree to which using TIC is positively or negatively valued by the clinician (significantly) matters in terms of its use. Thus, model standardization for clinicians working with women who have SUDs, broader adoption of trauma-informed care education among women’s SUD treatment agencies, and providing more supportive work environments for the use of TIC may increase clinician’s intention to use TIC in these agencies. Due to the struggles women have endured regarding receiving appropriate treatment for SUD (e.g., criminalization, lack of beds, inappropriate treatment methods, etc.) it is necessary to take steps forward in meeting the needs of these women. Systematic implementation of TIC in women’s SUD treatment by clinicians, although only one piece of the puzzle, is necessary to ensure women have the best chance of recovery."

    "contentSnippet": "Wildland fire is a main driving force in the Earth system and affects ecosystem properties and processes across spatio-temporal scales. The burning of biomass and production of solid fire residues (conventionally termed fire ash) that are a mixture of completely and incompletely burned materials (inorganic ash and pyrogenic carbon), represent the direct and prominent changes by fires. Cycling of the fire residues is an integral component of elemental cycles and can mediate other biogeochemical processes.\nThis dissertation aims to fill important knowledge gaps in understanding the disturbance of wildland fires to biogeochemical processes in soils. First, this work characterized and compared the chemical speciation and aqueous dissolution behaviors of macronutrients in fire ash produced across different ecosystems, providing a fundamental dataset and knowledge for exploring the cycling of fire ash. Next, the effects of pyrogenic carbon on soil biogeochemical conditions and processes were explored, through studying its interaction with extracellular enzymes and enzyme substrates, as well as the effects on enzyme activities.\nMain findings from this dissertational research include: 1) Variation in macronutrients speciation among wildfire ashes can be attributed to the vegetation composition and elemental stoichiometry of the biomass, as well as fire thermal conditions. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of how fires transform the chemistry of macronutrients and affect macronutrient returning to soils across different ecosystems, which is essential for evaluating the disturbance to ecosystem nutrient cycling by fires; 2) Adsorption of extracellular enzymes onto biochar surfaces is primarily driven by electrostatic interactions, and the extent of adsorption is affected by surface characteristics of the biochar, such as surface chemistry, pore structure, and functional groups; 3) Biochar can change the soil mobility and availability of organophosphates for enzymatic reactions through enzyme and enzyme substrates adsorption. 4) Biochar plays a significant role in modulating soil enzyme activity through direct enzyme and substrates adsorption. The adsorption of extracellular enzymes onto biochar varies with biochar type (feedstock and pyrolysis temperature), which directly influences the degradation of organic matter and nutrient cycling. This study also highlights the importance of proper measurement and interpretation of enzyme activity in systems containing biochar, as conventional enzyme assays may not fully account for biochar's complex role in biochar-substrate-enzyme interactions.\nIn addition, the research synthesizes current knowledge on the microbial decomposition of biochar, linking soil microbial processes with biochemical transformations. It emphasizes the variations in biochar stability and microbial community responses, contributing to an improved understanding of biochar's role in the global carbon cycle and its environmental stability.\nIn summary, this dissertation advances the understanding of the effects of fire residues on nutrients speciation and cycling, enzymes and enzymes substrates adsorption, and enzyme activity."

    "contentSnippet": "The French Foreign Legion, part of the July Monarchy’s 1831 expansion of the Army of Africa, sought to create a non-French force entirely deployable outside of the metropole. The creation of the expatriate corps intended to solve two of France’s most pressing problems at the time: an excess of foreign migrants at home, and a dearth of French soldiers abroad. The Paris government hoped to attract recruits from its considerable non-national male population, particularly political exiles and migrant workers fleeing Europe’s 1830 revolutionary wave. Initially intended as a temporary expedient for the homeland’s demographic crisis, the expatriate fighting force grew to become one of the most recognizable units in the Army of Africa, the embodiment of both the best and worst of the nation’s martial masculine heritage. But the project betrayed an inherent contradiction, one that continued to plague both the Legion and France’s imperial legacy in Algeria for more than a century to come: a French corps comprised almost entirely of non-French members, raised in France but destined to serve only beyond its borders. From the Legion’s very inception France struggled to precisely define the relationship between the homeland and this body of foreigners fighting in its name. And this ambiguity led to more than a crisis of conscience: it bore very real consequences for the people who toiled within its ranks and relinquished their lives and senses of self in pursuit of France’s colonial power. The Foreign Legion from 1831 to 1854 became an arena in which competing views of French national identity played out. At the heart of the struggle, the foreign recruits challenged assumptions as they negotiated their participation in France’s efforts to assimilate them into the imperial project."

    "contentSnippet": "Background: Cleaning work involves potential exposures to physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial hazards, which may increase the risk of birth defects. Yet, there is limited research focused on maternal occupation cleaning-related jobs and the risk of birth defects. We sought to investigate the association between selected birth defects and maternal occupation as a cleaner during early pregnancy in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), a case-control study from 1997-2011.\nMethods: Participants self-reported job details, which was classified by experts into cleaners or non-cleaner occupations. Cases were live births or stillbirths ascertained with birth defects from state surveillance systems, while controls were randomly selected live births without structural defects. We obtained adjusted ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from multivariable logistic regression for associations between maternal cleaning occupations and birth defects, controlling for eight confounders identified a priori. We conducted two sensitivity analyses focusing on isolated birth defects and those who worked more than 40 hours.\nResults: There were 1109 participants (868 cases/241 controls) with a primary occupational code as a cleaner during early pregnancy. In total, nine of the 19 included birth defects had elevated odds ratios (>1.5), ranging from 1.58 for anophthalmia/microphthalmia to 2.65 for esophageal atresia/stenosis; six had CIs that excluded the null.\nConclusions: Our study found that maternal occupation in cleaning-related jobs was associated with specific birth defects. Further studies are necessary to provide a clearer understanding of how these occupations during early pregnancy might affect infant development."

    "contentSnippet": "This thesis examines the concept of information within the realm of quantum physics, investigating the nuanced relationship between information and physical laws as applied to quantum systems. With no consensus on a single definition of information in the physical sciences, our exploration is partitioned into two significant studies, each addressing distinct aspects of information in quantum contexts.\nIn the first study, we concentrate on the information that can be obtained from measurement results on identical quantum systems. The traditional approach of using Shannon entropy is limited due to its applicability primarily to discrete probability distributions. By incorporating a Bayesian update framework, we redefine the process of information gain, which allows for a more nuanced understanding of information dynamics within quantum measurements. Key findings from this approach include a novel expression for quantifying information gain and a principle for the selection of appropriate priors, specifically employing Jeffreys’ prior for binomial distributions. The study also highlights the effectiveness of Jeffreys' binomial prior in optimizing quantum communication scenarios, such as maximizing the information deciphered by a receiver (Bob) from a sender’s (Alice) message-encoded qubits.\nThe second study shifts focus to the foundational aspects of quantum theory itself, employing an informational approach to reconstruct the theory’s underlying structure. Here, quantum measurements are conceptualized as finite outcome questions linked through classical logical operations within systems extending beyond binary dimensions. By introducing intuitive informational postulates, we achieve a partial reconstruction of quantum theory, particularly within systems characterized by prime number dimensions. This reconstruction yields rich connections between classical logical gates, generalized Pauli matrices, and mutually unbiased bases, enhancing our comprehension of how information flows during measurements on maximally entangled systems."

    "contentSnippet": "Tin halide perovskites are a growing candidate in the semiconducting materials field due to their band gap, and ability to be doped (specifically p-type doped). Halide perovskites are sensitive to light and air which causes the degradation of the material from its preferred cubic perovskite lattice. This thesis introduces a way of stabilizing bulk CsSnCl3 through the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. It will also introduce potential new ways to p-type dope halide perovskites. We attempted to p-type dope our halide perovskite by substitutional, interstitial, and vacancy doping to increase the carrier concentration to compete with current perovskites. During our trials of different doping techniques, annealing in air presented the most promising results. However, we would need an extensive atmosphere control setup to improve upon these results. Finding a successful p-type doped halide perovskite will push the semiconducting field into a new age of conducting materials."

    "link": "https://scholarsarchive.library.albany.edu/etd/62",
    "pubDate": "2024-12-09T16:30:33.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a diverse group of over 40 genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders, many of which are caused by a trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of specific genes. These expansions lead to the production of polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts that interfere with normal protein function, triggering cellular dysfunction and contributing to disease pathogenesis. The most well-known of these SCAs, such as SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3, exhibit progressive neurodegeneration, yet the precise mechanisms through which these mutations cause disease remain poorly understood.\nA significant challenge in studying CAG repeat expansion disorders lies in the complexity of the disease mechanisms, compounded by the lack of models that allow for the simultaneous investigation of various SCAs in a disease-independent, mechanism-agnostic context. To address this gap, we developed two cell lines that recapitulate the key transcriptional hallmarks of CAG repeat SCAs. One cell line stably expresses 60 CAG repeats, while the other utilizes an inducible system to control the expression of CAG repeats, offering a dynamic model to study transcriptional regulation and its effects on cellular physiology.\nWhile the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders are still not fully understood, there is even less knowledge about the in vivo structural dynamics of CAG repeat RNA. It remains unclear whether the RNA structure itself contributes to disease progression and, moreover, whether RNA-targeted therapeutics can be developed. To bridge this knowledge gap, we employed SHAPE-MaP (Selective 2'-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension and Mutational Profiling) experiments to investigate the RNA secondary structure of CAG repeats in a cellular environment. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first study of CAG repeat RNA in a cellular context using SHAPE-MaP, providing novel insights into the in cell behavior of these repeats.\nWe also explored the effect of a small molecule, previously identified as a selective modulator of CAG RNA levels. Our findings revealed that CAG repeat RNA adopts more flexible structures in a cell-free environment compared to the cellular environment, where molecular chaperones or RNA-binding proteins likely stabilize the RNA, limiting flexibility. Notably, we observed that in the cell-free condition, CAG repeats form multiple hairpin structures, while in the cellular context, only one predominant long hairpin structure was present, indicating that the cellular environment plays a crucial role in stabilizing the RNA structure. This suggests that in the absence of stabilizing factors, CAG repeats may adopt more conformations, which could contribute to their pathological behavior.\nThis study provides the first direct evidence of CAG repeat RNA's structural behavior in a cellular environment, offering valuable insights into the molecular dynamics of CAG repeats in SCAs. These findings could ultimately contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies targeting CAG repeat RNA, focusing on its structural stabilization or the modulation of RNA-protein interactions."

    "pubDate": "2024-12-09T15:55:30.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "A consensus view within the literature on perpetrator behavior in mass atrocities holds that perpetrators tend to be psychologically typical rather than atypical and thus, that even “ordinary” people are capable of extreme acts of violence against civilians when the right combination of social-psychological forces is at work. Whereas much prior research speaks in some way to this claim’s validity, no prior study of which I am aware has directly investigated laypeople’s beliefs regarding the truth of this proposition. Here, I report findings from four preregistered studies (total N = 1,256) investigating the contents, correlates, and consequences of lay theories about perpetrators’ psychological (a)typicality. Challenging prior assumptions about these beliefs, I found them to be roughly normally distributed within nationwide U.S. samples, with approximately half of participants reporting relatively neutral or ambivalent views on this topic and similar-sized minorities endorsing clearer “exceptionalist” or “normalist” theories of perpetrator behavior. Variability in these beliefs was found to be related to phenomena including beliefs in pure evil, moral objectivism, the blatant dehumanization of perpetrators, and moral disengagement with respect to political outgroup members and perpetrators of atrocity crimes abroad; however, manipulations of these beliefs failed to yield clear causal effects upon intergroup cognition and behavior in two experiments. Collectively, these findings help address a surprising omission from the extensive literature on the “banality of evil” while opening up several promising avenues for future research on lay conceptions of collective violence and its perpetrators."

    "pubDate": "2024-11-25T21:12:51.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "This study, based on Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Lent et al., 1994, 2000), investigated the role of familial support in the STEM career development of Asian American college students. Participants included 446 first-year undergraduate students who identified as Asian or Asian American and had not declared an academic major. Due to multicollinearity, four initial familial support variables—instrumental assistance, career-related modeling, verbal encouragement, and emotional support—were regrouped into two: performance motivation (instrumental assistance and verbal encouragement) and career mentoring (career-related modeling and emotional support). Structural equation modeling showed acceptable fit for a modified model, and the results partially supported the hypothesized paths. Findings indicated that career mentoring, but not performance motivation, was directly and positively associated with STEM coping self-efficacy. No direct relation was found between the support variables and STEM outcome expectations, but career mentoring indirectly influenced outcome expectations through enhanced coping self-efficacy. Neither STEM coping self-efficacy nor outcome expectations had significant direct relations with STEM interest. Performance motivation, but not STEM interest, was directly related to STEM goals. Participants’ generation status was controlled for in all structural analyses. Gender could not be tested as a moderator due to anomalies in the gender analyses, which prevented a credible interpretation of findings related to gender differences. Due to the unique characteristics of the present sample recruited for this study, caution was implicated in interpreting the results and recommending future research. Despite the limitations, the results provided some suggestions about how mental health professionals and educators might develop more effective interventions to support Asian and Asian American students in their pursuit of STEM careers."

    "contentSnippet": "Previous research on the immigrant health paradox among children and adolescents show a mental health advantage yet it is unclear if this applies in a similar magnitude to females (Fillion et al., 2018; Zarei et al., 2023). Immigrants may be exposed to stressors related to immigration and acculturation. Some research suggests that females respond more to stress through internalizing symptoms relative to males (Hall-Lande et al., 2007; Adkins et al., 2009). Given these gender differences in stress response, female immigrants may be particularly vulnerable to the psychological consequences of immigration related stressors. The immigrant health paradox has also overlooked subjective measures of body weight such as body image which may provide insight into how immigrants adjust to a new context. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, this study explores whether overestimating weight and depressive symptoms differ by nativity status among Asian and Hispanic female adolescents. The findings show no evidence that Asian and Hispanic female’s depressive symptoms differ by nativity status nor was there any evidence that overestimating weight differs by nativity status among these subgroups. In sum, this study provides an estimate of how ethnicity and nativity status affect body image and depressive symptoms across U.S. adolescent females. The findings contribute to our understanding of the immigrant health paradox and suggest that it is not applicable to all health outcomes."

In this study, we use quantitative content analysis to examine the content, style, structure, and interactivity of 18 Mesonet websites from across the contiguous United States. We find that Mesonet websites vary in the type and amount of content they include. For website style, we find that Mesonet websites primarily present their content with maps and data filters. We find that the structure of the website content was consistent across websites. Finally, we find that most Mesonet websites lacked interactivity, or visual feedback, which inhibits ease of use.

As this condition is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, with a strong evidence base supporting early identification, intervention and parenting practices to promote social communication development, a large portion of the research has focused on identifying characteristics of parent-child interactions amongst this population and determining how best to intervene on the family level to promote the development of these skills (Ku et al., 2019). There have been a variety of tools developed to achieve this goal, but there is a strong need for an observational behavioral coding system that has been standardized across neurotypical and autistic populations, as this would best facilitate comparisons of parent-child interactions across these populations. The current study sought to investigate a tool with that potential. Specifically, this exploratory study sought to identify the parent and child characteristics that are related to behaviors coded for using the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System, Fourth Edition (Eyberg et al., 2013). Additionally, this study sought to identify whether there were differences between in-person and virtual observations of the parent-child interactions. Results indicated that no differences were observed between the virtual and in-person observations of the parent-child interactions in the study. There were several parent and child characteristics that were correlated with specific parent and child interactive behaviors. Strengths and limitations of the study, as well as its implications for future research, are discussed."

    "pubDate": "2024-10-24T22:45:25.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "Quinary interactions arise due to the extreme macromolecular crowding inside live cells. Quinary interactions affect intracellular protein stability, activity, and homeostasis. Ribosomes, traditionally known for their role in protein synthesis, have been found to engage in quinary interactions with metabolic enzymes, modulating their activity and thereby revealing a potential regulatory role for ribosomes in cellular metabolism. This phenomenon, termed the Ribosome-Amplified MetaBOlism (RAMBO) effect, was investigated in this dissertation through a series of in vitro and in vivo studies using primarily Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\nFirstly, an NMR-based direct enzyme assay compatible with ribosome was developed and validated using pyruvate kinase (PYK) from Bacillus stearothermophilus as a probe. A high-quality Escherichia coli 70S ribosomes preparation was developed. Highly purified ribosomes were used to ensure that the observed amplification in enzyme activity was solely attributable to ribosomal interactions. Ribosomes were shown to significantly enhance the PYK activity and chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) was used to identify key ribosomal binding sites of PYK, supporting the RAMBO effect.\nNext, a general mechanism for the RAMBO effect was proposed and elucidated, where the ribosome external electric field (EEF)-substrate dipole interaction energy stabilizes transition states, significantly increasing the activity of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) from Gallus gallus. NMR spectroscopy was performed to examine the quinary interaction surface of TPI binding to the ribosomes, and to access the TPI kinetic assay. XL-MS coupled with molecular docking were used to determine the potential TPI-ribosome binding conformations, providing structural models for the electric fields and substrate dipoles calculations. Ribosomal protein L11 was identified as the primary binding partner of TPI, confirming the origin of the RAMBO effect.\nFinally, the in vivo RAMBO effect was studied in the context of glycolysis in E. coli using real-time pulse chase (RTPC)-NMR. The activity of pyruvate kinase I (PYFK) from E. coli was significantly enhanced in the presence of ribosomes, but this ribosome-mediated amplification was disrupted by the addition of ribosomal antibiotics in vitro. Kinetic flux profiling (KFP) further demonstrated the RAMBO effect observed in vitro also occurs in live cells, thereby confirming the role of ribosomes metabolic regulation and validating the RAMBO hypothesis."

This dissertation explores the application of Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning for three critical areas: evaluating perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure in wildlife, authenticating tuna species in the seafood industry, identifying body fluids at crime scenes, and medical diagnostics.\nFirst, Raman spectroscopy and support vector machine discriminant analysis (SVMDA) were employed to detect PFAS levels in the blood plasma of smallmouth bass from two different tributaries, rivers, or streams that flow into larger bodies of water. The method achieved 100% accuracy in differentiating between samples containing either low or high PFAS concentrations, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool for fish health.\nSecond, the capability of Raman spectroscopy to authenticate three commonly sold tuna species—yellowfin, bluefin, and escolar was assessed. The developed method accurately identified the species using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), demonstrating its value as a quality control tool in the seafood industry to prevent fraudulent labeling.\nThird, Raman spectroscopy combined with Random Forest machine learning was utilized to identify six main body fluids and distinguish them from 49 potential environmental interferences that may be discovered at crime scenes. The method achieved 100% accuracy in external validation, indicating its effectiveness as a rapid, non-destructive technique for body fluid detection, which is crucial for criminal investigations.\nLastly, the detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was explored using a novel screening method combining Raman spectroscopy with deep learning, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to analyze blood plasma. The ANN model demonstrated high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in distinguishing between moderate AD patients and healthy controls. This integrative approach offers a promising, non-invasive, rapid, and accurate screening method for early AD detection, potentially enhancing diagnostic capabilities and paving the way for earlier and more effective therapeutic interventions.\nOverall, this research showcases the versatility and efficacy of Raman spectroscopy and machine learning in providing reliable, accurate, and rapid analysis across different fields. Thus offering significant advancements in environmental monitoring, food authentication, and forensic science."

One of the most promising directions is the employment of single-source precursors (SSPs), defined as molecules that contain all necessary elements in the proper ratio and decomposable under mild conditions to yield phase-pure target compounds upon the low-temperature decomposition. This method both optimizes the synthetic pathways to existing materials and provides an access to new materials that are not accessible by conventional techniques.\nIn this dissertation, the advancement of multiple SSPs through appropriate methods with delicate design steps is described. In general, this work contributes to developing new preparation techniques for prospective Li- and Na-ion metal oxides for rechargeable batteries, as well as to applying the SSP approach to synthesize and characterize unknown materials. At the same time, this thesis provides a detailed analysis of the structure and properties of different SSPs and highlights some unusual cases of isomerism. The isomerization phenomenon not only alter the precursor design approach but also affects the thermal decomposition properties related to the synthesis of target materials."

    "contentSnippet": "In senescence that occurs with aging, cells stop dividing and initiate a pro-inflammatory program called the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP can lead to cell damage and has been linked to age-related conditions such as cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and osteoarthritis. The epitranscriptome regulates translation through post-transcriptional RNA modifications and can control when and how much of protein synthesis occurs. Several tRNA modifications that include 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5U), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U), and mcm5Um (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2′-O-methyluridine) are linked to the translation of enzymes involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and defects in these tRNA modifications have been shown to promote senescence. We examined the reprogramming of tRNA modifications in response to pharmaceuticals that limit senescence or SASP in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and human lung fibroblast (IMR-90) cells. These cells were treated with senolytics (Navitoclax and Quercetin) and senomorphs (Metformin and Taurine). Small RNA was purified to analyze tRNA modifications by LC-MS/MS. We have demonstrated that senolytics and senomorphs can re-program tRNA modifications in wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts, specifically 5-methylthio-2-methyluracil (s2mo5U), 7-methylguanosine (m7G), 5-methylcytosine-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U), 2’-O-methylguanosine (Gm), N1-Methyladenosine (m1A), and 5-methoxyuridine (mo5U). We have also demonstrated that senolytics and senomorphs can re-program tRNA modifications in senescent human lung fibroblasts, specifically 7-methylguanosine (m7G), 1-methylguanosine (m1G), N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m22G), 2-methylguanosine (m2G), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), N6-methyladenosine (m6Am), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5U), 2-thiocytidine (s2C), and pseudouridine (Ψ), with our studies being some of the first to explore this hypothesis. Our studies highlight the potential of using senolytic and senomorphic therapeutic agents to treat tRNA-related diseases."

    "pubDate": "2024-10-21T14:15:26.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "Video self-modeling (VSM) is an intervention based on Bandura’s (1999) theory of observational learning, which assumes that children learn a target behavior by observing a more competent model. VSM is assumed to provide an effective model from which children can learn given that the learner and model are the same person but differ only in their skills. More recently, studies have explored the effectiveness of VSM as an intervention for oral reading fluency (ORF) and showed promising results. Goal setting (GS) is another intervention that has been found to be effective in increasing students’ performance by motivating them to meet their goal and self-monitor their progress.\nThe current study aimed to expand the existing reading intervention literature by evaluating the effectiveness of VSM as a standalone intervention as well as the additive effect of integrating GS with VSM on ORF. The hypotheses were that VSM alone would be effective in increasing students’ ORF and that adding GS to VSM would further enhance the effectiveness of VSM. The participants were four general education students in third grade who were identified as needing additional reading support due to performing below grade level expectations based on their school’s multi-tier systems of support (MTSS) universal reading assessment. All students were concurrently receiving small group reading interventions from their school.\nA multiple-baseline design across participants was used with each participant being exposed to four phases in the following order: 1) baseline, 2) VSM, 3) VSM with GS, and 4) maintenance. To analyze the results, a combination of visual analysis, in accordance with the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC; Kratochwill et al., 2010) standards, and hierarchical linear modeling, was utilized.\nConsistent with previous studies, the results showed that VSM alone was associated with an increase in words correct per minute (WCPM) where the four participants averaged an increase of 8.5 WCPM (RangeΔ = 2.00 - 14.20) compared to baseline. Additionally, the additive effect of GS when combined with VSM produced an additional average increase of 10.37 WCPM (RangeΔ= 2.63 – 18.67) across participants. Despite this increase in average ORF performance, the results of the visual analysis revealed inconsistent immediate effects and trends, as well as high variability and overlap across phases and participants. Therefore, the interventions did not demonstrate sufficient intervention effects to support their effectiveness based on the WWC criteria. The results from the HLM analysis supported the visual analysis as they revealed treatment effects that lacked statistical significance. A discussion of the interpretation, implications, and limitations of the results as well as future directions is provided."

    "pubDate": null,
    "contentSnippet": "Thirty-five  years ago today (November 2nd), the Internet Worm program was set loose to propagate on the Internet.  Noting that now to the computing public (and cybersecurity professionals, specifically) often generates an \"Oh, really?\" response akin to stating that November 2nd is the anniversary of the inaugural broadcast of the first BBC TV channel (1936), and the launch of Sputnik 2 with Laika aboard (1957).  That is, to many, it is ho-hum, ancient history.\nPerhaps that is to be expected after 35 years -- approximately the length of a human generation. (As an aside, I have been teaching at Purdue for 36 years. I have already taught students whose parents had taken one of my classes as a student; in five or so years, I may see students whose grandparents took one of my classes!). In 1988, fewer than 100,000 machines were likely connected to the Internet; thus, only a few thousand people were involved in systems administration and security. For us, the events were more profound, but we are outnumbered by today's user population; many of us have retired from the field...and more than a few have passed on. Thus, events of decades ago have become ancient history for current users.\nNonetheless, the event and its aftermath were profound for those who lived through it. No major security incident had ever occurred on such a scale before.  The Worm was the top news story in international media for days. The events retold in Cliff Stoll's Cuckoo's Egg were only a few years earlier but had affected far fewer systems. However, that tale of computer espionage heightened concern by authorities in the days following the Worm's deployment regarding its origin and purpose. It seeded significant changes in law enforcement, defense funding and planning, and how we all looked at interconnectivity. In the following years, malware (and especially non-virus malware) became an increasing problem, from Code Red and Nimda to today's botnets and ransomware. All of that eventually led to a boom in add-on security measures, resulting in what is now a multi-billion dollar cybersecurity industry. \nAt the time of the Worm, the study of computing security (the term \"cybersecurity\" had not yet appeared) was primarily based around cryptography, formal verification of program correctness, and limiting covert channels.  The Worm illustrated that there was a larger scope needed, although it took additional events (such as the aforementioned worms and malware) to drive the message home.  Until the late 1990s, many people still believed  cybersecurity was simply a matter of attentive cyber hygiene and not an independent, valid field of study. (I frequently encountered this attitude in academic circles, and was told it was present in the discussion leading to my tenure. That may seem difficult to believe today, but should not be surprising: Purdue has the oldest degree-granting CS department [60 years old this year], and it was initially viewed by some as simply glorified accounting! It is often the case that outsiders dismiss an emerging discipline as trivial or irrelevant.) \nThe Worm provided us with an object lesson about many issues that, unfortunately, were not heeded in full to this day.  That multi-billion dollar cybersecurity industry is still failing to protect far too many of our systems.  Among those lessons:\nInterconnected systems with long-lasting access (e.g., .rshrc files) created a playground for lateral movement across enterprises.  We knew then that good security practice involved fully mediated access (now often referred to as \"Zero Trust\") and had known that for some time.  However, convenience was viewed as more important than security...a problem that continues to vex us to this day.  We continue to build systems that both enable effortless lateral movement, and  make it difficult or annoying for users to reauthenticate, thus leading them to bypass the checks.\nSystems without separation of privilege facilitated the spread of malware.  Current attackers who manage to penetrate key services or privileged accounts are able to gain broader access to entire networks, including the ability to shut off monitoring and updates.  We have proven methods of limiting access (SELinux is one example) but they are too infrequently used. \nSharing information across organizations can result in a more robust, more timely response.  Today, we still have organizations that refuse to disclose if they have been compromised, thus delaying our societal response; information obtained by government agencies has too often been classified, or at least closely held.. The information that is shared is frequently incomplete or not timely. \nThe use of type-unsafe languages with minimal security features can lead to flaws that may be exploited.  One only needs to survey recent CVE entries and attack reports to see buffer overflows, type mismatches, and other well-known software flaws leading to compromise.  Many organizations are still producing or reusing software written in C or C++ that are especially prone to such errors.  Sadly, higher education is complicit by teaching those languages as primary, mainly because their graduates may not be employable without them.\nHeterogenity of systems provides some bulwark against common attacks.  Since 1988, the number of standard operating systems in use has decreased, as has the underlying machine architectures. There are clearly economic arguments for reduced numbers of platforms, but the homogeneity facilitates common attacks. Consideration of when to reuse and when to build new is sadly infrequent.\nThe Worm incident generated conflicting signals about the propriety of hacking into other people's systems and writing malware.  Some people who knew the Worm's author rose to his defense, claiming he was demonstrating security problems and not doing anything wrong. Malware authors and system attackers commonly made that same claim in the decades following, with mixed responses from the community. It still colors the thinking of many in the field, justifying some very dubious behavior as somehow justified by results. Although there is nuance in some discussions, the grey areas around pen testing, companies selling spyware, and \"ethical\" hacking still enable plausible explanations for bad behavior.\nThat last point is  important as we  debate the dangers and adverse side-effects of machine learning/LLM/AI systems.  Those are being refined and deployed by people claiming they are not responsible for the (mis)use of (or errors in) those systems and that their economic potential outweighs any social costs.  We have failed to clearly understand and internalize that not everything that can be done  should be done, especially in the Internet at large.  This is an issue that keeps coming up and we continue to fail to address it properly.\nAs a field, cybersecurity is relatively young.  We have a history that arguably starts in the 1960s with the Ware Report.  We are still discovering what is involved in protecting systems, data privacy, and safety.  Heck, we still need a commonly accepted definition of what cybersecurity entails! (Cf. Chapter 1 of the Cybersecurity Myths book, referenced below.). The first cybersecurity degree program wasn't established until 2000 (at Purdue).  We still lack useful metrics to know whether we are making significant progress and titrate investment. And we are still struggling with tools and techniques to create and maintain secure systems.  All this while the market (and thus need) is expanding globally.\nIn that context of growth and need, we should not dismiss the past as \"Ho-hum, history.\" Members of the military study historic battles to avoid future mistakes: mentioning the Punic Wars or The Battle of Thermopylae to such a scholar will not result in dismissal with \"Not relevant.\"  If you are interested in cybersecurity, it would be advisable to study some history of the field and think about lessons learned -- and unlearned.\nFurther Reading\nThe Ware Report\nThis can be seen as one of the first descriptions of cybersecurity challenges, needs and approaches.\n\nThe protection of information in computer systems\nA paper from 1975 by J.H. Saltzer and M.D. Schroeder.  This paper refers to basic design principles, in large part inspired by Multics, that include complete mediation (now somewhat captured by \"Zero Trust\") and least privilege.  These are most often violated by software rather than designed in, especially economy of mechanism. \n (Versions of this paper may be found outside the paywall via web search engines.)\n\nHistorical papers archive\nA collection of historical papers presenting the early foundation of cybersecurity.  This includes the Ware Report, and its follow-on, the Anderson Report.  Some other, hard-to-find items are here.\n\nThe Communications of the ACM Worm Issue\nAn issue of CACM was devoted to papers about the Worm.\n\nThe Internet Worm: An Analysis\nMy full report analyzing what the Worm program did and how it was structured.\n\nThe Internet Worm Incident\nA report describing the timeline of the Worm release, spread, discovery, and response.\n\nHappy birthday, dear viruses\nThis is a short article in Science I coauthored with Richard Ford for the 25th anniversary of the Worm, about malware generally.\n\nCybersecurity Myths and Misconceptions\nA new book about things the public and even cybersecurity experts mistakenly believe about cybersecurity.  Chapter 1 addresses, in depth, how we do not have an accepted definition of cybersecurity or metrics to measure it.  Other items alluded to in this blog post are also addressed in the book.\n\nCyber security challenges and windmills\nOne of my blog posts, from 2009, about how we continue to generate studies of what would improve cybersecurity and then completely fail to heed them.  The situation has not improved in the years since then."
