        "Description": "This paper presents a novel approach for mitigating wormhole attacks on wireless networks using propagation delay timing. The wormhole attack is a persistent security threat that threatens the integrity of network communications, potentially leading to data theft or other malicious activities. While various methods exist for combating wormhole attacks, our approach offers advantages that set it apart. Our approach involves a combination of proactive and reactive measures, harnessing box plot analysis and weighting factor techniques to identify and isolate outlier node links effectively. Unlike traditional methods, our solution not only detects outlier links but also defines dynamic weighting factors, providing a more adaptive response to network anomalies. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, testing was conducted using a custom-built testbed running on an external network simulator. The results demonstrate that our proposed technique identifies outlier links, defines appropriate weighting factors, and isolates questionable links. Compared to existing methodologies, our approach exhibits better performance with easier installation and lower overhead while adapting to evolving attack strategies. In conclusion, this paper presents a practical and highly effective solution for mitigating wormhole attacks in wireless networks, distinguishing itself through its adaptability to changing networks while maintaining ease of installation and low overhead.",

        "Description": "Engagement is a critical part of student learning and student success. This is especially true in online classes where students have less interaction with their classmates and instructors when compared to traditional face-to-face courses. Research on engagement has shown that when students are meaningfully engaged it can increase student satisfaction and it may also increase levels of academic achievement, including grades earned and degree progression (e.g. Wong et al., 2024). This paper focuses on social engagement in a graduate cybersecurity program that uses large, expandable online courses as described by Whitman and Mattord (2023). Large online graduate classes (i.e., more than 35 students in one class) present a new challenge to educators who are traditionally accustomed to teaching graduate classes with much smaller enrollment. To help faculty meaningfully engage students in large online classes, this paper presents three strategies for faculty to synchronously connect with students in an asynchronous class: welcome events, drop-in sessions, and happy hours. Finally, this paper will also report the results from a survey administered to cybersecurity students in a large online class to measure their perceptions of engagement.",

In addition, a severe shortage of cybersecurity professionals has been proliferating for nearly as long. These problems exist in the United States and globally and are well documented in literature. This study examined what state universities are doing to help address the shortage of cybersecurity professionals since higher education institutions are a primary source to the workforce pipeline. It is suggested that the number of cybersecurity professionals entering the workforce is related to the number of available programs. Thus increasing the number of programs will increase the number of cybersecurity professionals entering the workforce. This study used a qualitative approach to examine the programs offered through a sample of 201 state universities using a document review of online academic catalogs. The research examined the quantities and levels of cybersecurity programs and identified the institutions that used the National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) structure to develop their programs. The results showed that an impressive 84.6% of the universities sampled offered a cybersecurity program and of which more than 50% received a CAE designation. Although the results were impressive, there are still unanswered questions requiring further study in regards to having a satisfactory number of programs to generate the needed talent to reduce the shortage. This study generated several important questions and recommendations and highlighted the availability of cybersecurity programs at the state university level at a snapshot in time. The results can be used to help identify any additional academic needs to help address the shortage of cybersecurity professionals.",

        "Description": "Detecting and mitigating wormhole attacks in wireless networks remains a critical challenge due to their deceptive nature and potential to compromise network integrity. This paper proposes a novel approach to wormhole detection by leveraging propagation delay analysis between network nodes. Unlike traditional methods that rely on signature-based detection or specialized hardware, our method focuses on analyzing propagation delay timings to identify anomalous behavior indicative of wormhole attacks. The proposed methodology involves collecting propagation delay data in both normal network scenarios and scenarios with inserted malicious wormhole nodes. By comparing these delay timings, our approach aims to differentiate between legitimate network paths and potential wormhole shortcuts. Utilizing the NS-3 network simulator, we validate the effectiveness of our method in accurately detecting and mitigating wormhole attacks. The key advantage of our approach lies in its proactive nature and ability to detect wormholes without relying on specific attack signatures or additional hardware. Using the consistency of propagation delay data, our method offers a promising avenue for early detection and prevention of wormhole attacks, thereby enhancing network security and reliability. The results and insights presented in this paper contribute to the ongoing efforts in developing defense mechanisms against sophisticated network attacks, emphasizing the potential of propagation delay analysis in addressing the challenges posed by wormhole threats in wireless networks.",

Many students struggle to focus on schoolwork, due to a lack of interest, lack of understanding, or other factors unique to the student. Applying gamification elements to education can help engage these students in learning their course material and help them excel academically. This study examines the effectiveness of using gamification techniques to enhance the learning experience in college Computer Science courses. A video game application is utilized to review and reinforce cybersecurity concepts that students have already been taught in class. Previous work has been made on a prototype game build that teaches about ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) components. The focus of this study is to refine and develop the structure of the prototype into a more interactive and enjoyable format with non-competitive and captivating activities that allow students to study at their own pace. An updated version of the game was created that focused on reaching a balance between education and entertainment. The game was used by students enrolled in a cybersecurity class, where pre-survey, post-survey and a focus group interview were conducted to determine how effective the updated version is compared to the current build, in addition to how effective the gamification method is regarding student retention of taught material. The pre-survey and post-survey results revealed an increase in interest and mastery of cybersecurity concepts as a result of playing the game. Students found value in the game as both a method of reviewing material taught in class and an entertaining and engaging game. These results show potential in using gamification in cybersecurity and education.",

We compared how different recognized \u201ccognitive\u201d transfer theories might help explain and synergize three aspects of cybersecurity education. These include teaching and training in diverse settings, assessing learning formatively & summatively, and testing & measuring achievement, proficiency, & readiness. We excluded newer sociocultural theories and their implications for inclusion as we explore those theories elsewhere. We first summarized the history of cybersecurity education and proficiency standards considering transfer theories. We then explored each theory and reviewed the most relevant cybersecurity education research; in some cases, we broadened our search to computing education. We concluded that (a) archaic differential transfer theories are still influential but have negative implications to be avoided, (b) constructionist theories are popular in K-12 settings but raise issues for assessment and transfer, (c) many embrace a general cognitive science perspective that can resolve tensions between modern cognitive-associationist and cognitive-constructivist theories that are popular with innovators, and (d) new perceptual and coordinative theories have potential worth exploring. These insights should support \u201cgenerative\u201d cybersecurity learning that transfers readily and widely to future classes, tests, and workplaces.

        "Description": "With the development of technology, security, a core human concern throughout history,has changed and branched out into new areas. Novel security concepts, including environmental security, economic security, and cybersecurity, have emerged as a result of these expanding areas. The importance of cybersecurity has increased in the linked world of today as a result of how prevalent technology is in our daily lives. This study looks at how the literature on international relations approaches the idea of cybersecurity, with an emphasis on the role gender dynamics play.\nThis study adopts a comprehensive strategy in recognition of the possibility that people of all genders may be affected by the dominant gender roles. The study seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity by utilizing a mixed-methods research methodology that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative techniques.\nConducting in-depth interviews with young adults (ages 18 to 27) who identify as people of different genders will be part of the field research. Various aspects of cybersecurity, such as perceptions of cybersecurity, emotions of security, and encounters with cyber dangers, will be covered in these interviews. The research will be carried out in both Turkey and Italy, enabling a comparison of the cybersecurity laws and conditions in these two nations.\nBy combining theoretical underpinnings with empirical fieldwork, this study aims to give a fresh viewpoint. The survey data will also be subjected to statistical analysis. The study's findings will shed light on how young adults' perceptions of cybersecurity are influenced by gender norms and what that means for cybersecurity laws.\nThis research contributes to the larger discussion on cybersecurity and gender studies by broadening its focus beyond gender as a binary construct and offering insightful information about how gender roles affect cybersecurity views across a range of identities.",

        "Description": "Data transfer between isolated clusters is imperative for cybersecurity education, research, and testing. Such techniques facilitate hands-on cybersecurity learning in isolated clusters, allow cybersecurity students to practice with various hacking tools, and develop professional cybersecurity technical skills. Educators often use these remote learning environments for research as well. Researchers and students use these isolated environments to test sophisticated hardware, software, and procedures using full-fledged operating systems, networks, and applications. Virus and malware researchers may wish to release suspected malicious software in a controlled environment to observe their behavior better or gain the information needed to assist their reverse engineering processes. The isolation prevents harm to networked systems. However, there are times when the data is required to move in such quantities or speeds that it makes downloading onto an intermediate device untenable. This study proposes a novel turnstile model, a mechanism for one-way file transfer from one enterprise system to another without allowing data leakage. This system protects data integrity and security by connecting the isolated environment to the external network via a locked-down interconnection. Using medium-security isolated clusters, the researchers successfully developed a unidirectional file transfer system that acts as a one-way \u201cturnstile\u201d for secure file transfer between systems not connected to the internet or other external networks. The Turnstile system (source code available at github.com/monnin/turnstile) provides unidirectional file transfer between two computer systems. The solution enabled data to be transferred from a source system to a destination system without allowing any data to be transferred back in the opposite direction. The researchers found an automated process of transferring external files to isolated clusters optimized the transfer speed of external files to isolated clusters using Linux distributions and commands.",

This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to overwrite the pointer to a not-yet-allocated buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet body. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the function to determine which state of packet parsing is currently occurring. Because the buffer is allocated when the last byte of the header has been copied, the combination of having a bad header length variable that will never match the counter variable and being able to overwrite the state variable with the resulting buffer overflow can be used to advance the function to the next step while skipping the buffer allocation and resulting pointer write. The next 16 bytes from the packet body are then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.2024-11-207.5CVE-2024-48981\narm -- mbed\n\u00a0An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. This value is assumed to be greater than or equal to 3, but the software doesn't ensure that this is the case. Supplying a length less than 3 leads to a buffer overflow in a buffer that is allocated later. It is simultaneously possible to cause another integer overflow by supplying large length values because the provided length value is increased by a few bytes to account for additional information that is supposed to be stored there. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.2024-11-207.5CVE-2024-48982\narm -- mbed\n\u00a0An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. During processing of HCI packets, the software dynamically determines the length of the packet data by reading 2 bytes from the packet header. A buffer is then allocated to contain the entire packet, the size of which is calculated as the length of the packet body determined earlier plus the header length. WsfMsgAlloc then increments this again by sizeof(wsfMsg_t). This may cause an integer overflow that results in the buffer being significantly too small to contain the entire packet. This may cause a buffer overflow of up to 65 KB . This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.2024-11-207.5CVE-2024-48983\narm -- mbed\n\u00a0An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. During processing of HCI packets, the software dynamically determines the length of the packet data by reading 2 bytes from the packet data. A buffer is then allocated to contain the entire packet, the size of which is calculated as the length of the packet body determined earlier and the header length. If the allocate fails because the specified packet is too large, no exception handling occurs and hciTrSerialRxIncoming continues to write bytes into the 4-byte large temporary header buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. This can be leveraged into an arbitrary write by an attacker. It is possible to overwrite the pointer to the buffer that is supposed to receive the contents of the packet body but which couldn't be allocated. One can then overwrite the state variable used by the function to determine which step of the parsing process is currently being executed. This advances the function to the next state, where it proceeds to copy data to that arbitrary location. The packet body is then written wherever the corrupted data pointer is pointing.2024-11-207.5CVE-2024-48985\narm -- mbed\n\u00a0An issue was discovered in MBed OS 6.16.0. Its hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of certain hci packets by reading a byte from its header. Certain events cause a callback, the logic for which allocates a buffer (the length of which is determined by looking up the event type in a table). The subsequent write operation, however, copies the amount of data specified in the packet header, which may lead to a buffer overflow. This bug is trivial to exploit for a denial of service but is not certain to suffice to bring the system down and can generally not be exploited further because the exploitable buffer is dynamically allocated.2024-11-207.5CVE-2024-48986\navlditest -- libdoip\n\u00a0A vulnerability was found in AVL-DiTEST-DiagDev libdoip 1.0.0.

This assumption is bogus since it's valid to create egress qdiscs with major handle ffff: Budimir Markovic found that for qdiscs like DRR that maintain an active class list, it will cause a UAF with a dangling class pointer. In 066a3b5b2346, the concern was to avoid iterating over the ingress qdisc since its parent is itself. The proper fix is to stop when parent TC_H_ROOT is reached because the only way to retrieve ingress is when a hierarchy which does not contain a ffff: major handle call into qdisc_lookup with TC_H_MAJ(TC_H_ROOT). In the scenario where major ffff: is an egress qdisc in any of the tree levels, the updates will also propagate to TC_H_ROOT, which then the iteration must stop. net/sched/sch_api.c | 2 +- 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)2024-11-197.8CVE-2024-53057\nlinux -- linux_kernel\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media: s5p-jpeg: prevent buffer overflows The current logic allows word to be less than 2.

It can be reproduced by following these steps(more details [1]): 1. Obtain more than 32 inputs that have similar hashes, which ends with the pattern '0xxxxxxxe6'. 2. Reboot and add the keys obtained in step 1. The reproducer demonstrates how this issue happened: 1. In the search_nested_keyrings function, when it iterates through the slots in a node(below tag ascend_to_node), if the slot pointer is meta and node->back_pointer != NULL(it means a root), it will proceed to descend_to_node. However, there is an exception. If node is the root, and one of the slots points to a shortcut, it will be treated as a keyring. 2. Whether the ptr is keyring decided by keyring_ptr_is_keyring function. However, KEYRING_PTR_SUBTYPE is 0x2UL, the same as ASSOC_ARRAY_PTR_SUBTYPE_MASK. 3. When 32 keys with the similar hashes are added to the tree, the ROOT has keys with hashes that are not similar (e.g. slot 0) and it splits NODE A without using a shortcut. When NODE A is filled with keys that all hashes are xxe6, the keys are similar, NODE A will split with a shortcut. Finally, it forms the tree as shown below, where slot 6 points to a shortcut. NODE A +------>+---+ ROOT | | 0 | xxe6 +---+ | +---+ xxxx | 0 | shortcut : : xxe6 +---+ | +---+ xxe6 : : | | | xxe6 +---+ | +---+ | 6 |---+ : : xxe6 +---+ +---+ xxe6 : : | f | xxe6 +---+ +---+ xxe6 | f | +---+ 4. As mentioned above, If a slot(slot 6) of the root points to a shortcut, it may be mistakenly transferred to a key*, leading to a read out-of-bounds read. To fix this issue, one should jump to descend_to_node if the ptr is a shortcut, regardless of whether the node is root or not.

Prior to version 2.13.0, the multipart form parser shipped with litestar expects the entire request body as a single byte string and there is no default limit for the total size of the request body. This allows an attacker to upload arbitrary large files wrapped in a `multipart/form-data` request and cause excessive memory consumption on the server. The multipart form parser in affected versions is vulnerable to this type of attack by design. The public method signature as well as its implementation both expect the entire request body to be available as a single byte string. It is not possible to accept large file uploads in a safe way using this parser. This may be a regression, as a variation of this issue was already reported in CVE-2023-25578. Limiting the part number is not sufficient to prevent out-of-memory errors on the server.

Prior to version 0.4.0, the HTML Parser in lxml does not properly handle context-switching for special HTML tags such as `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`. This behavior deviates from how web browsers parse and interpret such tags. Specifically, content in CSS comments is ignored by lxml_html_clean but may be interpreted differently by web browsers, enabling malicious scripts to bypass the cleaning process. This vulnerability could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, compromising the security of users relying on lxml_html_clean in default configuration for sanitizing untrusted HTML content. Users employing the HTML cleaner in a security-sensitive context should upgrade to lxml 0.4.0, which addresses this issue. As a temporary mitigation, users can configure lxml_html_clean with the following settings to prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability. Via `remove_tags`, one may specify tags to remove - their content is moved to their parents' tags. Via `kill_tags`, one may specify tags to be removed completely. Via `allow_tags`, one may restrict the set of permissible tags, excluding context-switching tags like `<svg>`, `<math>` and `<noscript>`.2024-11-196.1CVE-2024-52595\ngoogle -- android\n\u00a0In SMF_ParseMetaEvent of eas_smf.c, there is a possible integer overflow.

A large number of cpuset cgroups are deleted. 2. Set cpu on and off repeatly. 3. Set watchdog_thresh repeatly. The scripts can be obtained at LINK mentioned above the signature. The reason for this issue is cgroup_mutex and cpu_hotplug_lock are acquired in different tasks, which may lead to deadlock. It can lead to a deadlock through the following steps: 1. A large number of cpusets are deleted asynchronously, which puts a large number of cgroup_bpf_release works into system_wq. The max_active of system_wq is WQ_DFL_ACTIVE(256). Consequently, all active works are cgroup_bpf_release works, and many cgroup_bpf_release works will be put into inactive queue. As illustrated in the diagram, there are 256 (in the acvtive queue) + n (in the inactive queue) works. 2. Setting watchdog_thresh will hold cpu_hotplug_lock.read and put smp_call_on_cpu work into system_wq. However step 1 has already filled system_wq, 'sscs.work' is put into inactive queue. 'sscs.work' has to wait until the works that were put into the inacvtive queue earlier have executed (n cgroup_bpf_release), so it will be blocked for a while. 3. Cpu offline requires cpu_hotplug_lock.write, which is blocked by step 2. 4. Cpusets that were deleted at step 1 put cgroup_release works into cgroup_destroy_wq. They are competing to get cgroup_mutex all the time. When cgroup_metux is acqured by work at css_killed_work_fn, it will call cpuset_css_offline, which needs to acqure cpu_hotplug_lock.read. However, cpuset_css_offline will be blocked for step 3. 5. At this moment, there are 256 works in active queue that are cgroup_bpf_release, they are attempting to acquire cgroup_mutex, and as a result, all of them are blocked. Consequently, sscs.work can not be executed. Ultimately, this situation leads to four processes being blocked, forming a deadlock. system_wq(step1) WatchDog(step2) cpu offline(step3) cgroup_destroy_wq(step4) ... 2000+ cgroups deleted asyn 256 actives + n inactives __lockup_detector_reconfigure P(cpu_hotplug_lock.read) put sscs.work into system_wq 256 + n + 1(sscs.work) sscs.work wait to be executed warting sscs.work finish percpu_down_write P(cpu_hotplug_lock.write) ...blocking... css_killed_work_fn P(cgroup_mutex) cpuset_css_offline P(cpu_hotplug_lock.read) ...blocking... 256 cgroup_bpf_release mutex_lock(&cgroup_mutex); ..blocking... To fix the problem, place cgroup_bpf_release works on a dedicated workqueue which can break the loop and solve the problem. System wqs are for misc things which shouldn't create a large number of concurrent work items.

Also move it into the loops to have a smaller scope. Using a u32 there is fine, we limit the number of APs in the scan list and each has a limit on the number of RNR entries due to the frame size. With a limit of 1000 scan results, a frame size upper bound of 4096 (really it's more like ~2300) and a TBTT entry size of at least 11, we get an upper bound for the number of ~372k, well in the bounds of a u32.2024-11-195.5CVE-2024-53055\nlinux -- linux_kernel\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/mediatek: Fix potential NULL dereference in mtk_crtc_destroy() In mtk_crtc_create(), if the call to mbox_request_channel() fails then we set the \"mtk_crtc->cmdq_client.chan\" pointer to NULL. In that situation, we do not call cmdq_pkt_create(). During the cleanup, we need to check if the \"mtk_crtc->cmdq_client.chan\" is NULL first before calling cmdq_pkt_destroy(). Calling cmdq_pkt_destroy() is unnecessary if we didn't call cmdq_pkt_create() and it will result in a NULL pointer dereference.2024-11-195.5CVE-2024-53056\nlinux -- linux_kernel\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data In case the non-paged data of a SKB carries protocol header and protocol payload to be transmitted on a certain platform that the DMA AXI address width is configured to 40-bit/48-bit, or the size of the non-paged data is bigger than TSO_MAX_BUFF_SIZE on a certain platform that the DMA AXI address width is configured to 32-bit, then this SKB requires at least two DMA transmit descriptors to serve it. For example, three descriptors are allocated to split one DMA buffer mapped from one piece of non-paged data: dma_desc[N + 0], dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2]. Then three elements of tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[] will be allocated to hold extra information to be reused in stmmac_tx_clean(): tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0], tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1], tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2]. Now we focus on tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf, which is the DMA buffer address returned by DMA mapping call. stmmac_tx_clean() will try to unmap the DMA buffer _ONLY_IF_ tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is a valid buffer address. The expected behavior that saves DMA buffer address of this non-paged data to tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf is: tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = NULL; tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL; tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = dma_map_single(); Unfortunately, the current code misbehaves like this: tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf = dma_map_single(); tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 1].buf = NULL; tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 2].buf = NULL; On the stmmac_tx_clean() side, when dma_desc[N + 0] is closed by the DMA engine, tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[N + 0].buf is a valid buffer address obviously, then the DMA buffer will be unmapped immediately. There may be a rare case that the DMA engine does not finish the pending dma_desc[N + 1], dma_desc[N + 2] yet. Now things will go horribly wrong, DMA is going to access a unmapped/unreferenced memory region, corrupted data will be transmited or iommu fault will be triggered :( In contrast, the for-loop that maps SKB fragments behaves perfectly as expected, and that is how the driver should do for both non-paged data and paged frags actually. This patch corrects DMA map/unmap sequences by fixing the array index for tx_q->tx_skbuff_dma[entry].buf when assigning DMA buffer address.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it. On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption that the register functions already did the needed checks. This can be fragile if some device ends using different calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers like Coverity. So, add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues.2024-11-195.5CVE-2024-53063\nlinux -- linux_kernel\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: idpf: fix idpf_vc_core_init error path In an event where the platform running the device control plane is rebooted, reset is detected on the driver. It releases all the resources and waits for the reset to complete. Once the reset is done, it tries to build the resources back. At this time if the device control plane is not yet started, then the driver timeouts on the virtchnl message and retries to establish the mailbox again. In the retry flow, mailbox is deinitialized but the mailbox workqueue is still alive and polling for the mailbox message. This results in accessing the released control queue leading to null-ptr-deref. Fix it by unrolling the work queue cancellation and mailbox deinitialization in the reverse order which they got initialized.2024-11-195.5CVE-2024-53064\nlinux -- linux_kernel\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm/slab: fix warning caused by duplicate kmem_cache creation in kmem_buckets_create Commit b035f5a6d852 (\"mm: slab: reduce the kmalloc() minimum alignment if DMA bouncing possible\") reduced ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN to 8 on arm64.

But when ACPI is enabled we go through a specific branch which returns early and does not call 'of_node_put' for the node that was acquired. Since we are not using a CPU device node for the ACPI code anyways, we can simply move the initialization of it just passed the ACPI block, and we are guaranteed to have an 'of_node_put' call for the acquired node. This prevents a bad reference count of the CPU device node. Moreover, the previous function did not check for errors when acquiring the device node, so a return -ENOENT has been added for that case.2024-11-195.5CVE-2024-53075\nlinux -- linux_kernel\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: iio: gts-helper: Fix memory leaks for the error path of iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table() If per_time_scales[i] or per_time_gains[i] kcalloc fails in the for loop of iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table(), the err_free_out will fail to call kfree() each time when i is reduced to 0, so all the per_time_scales[0] and per_time_gains[0] will not be freed, which will cause memory leaks.

Address the issue that occurs under heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN filters by setting mac and port VLAN. 1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan(). 2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac(). 3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption. Reproduction steps: 1. Spawn multiple VFs. 2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host. 3. Observe errors in dmesg: \"Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX, please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX\". Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now. The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state, I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list. These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but must be removed using the full process.2024-11-194.7CVE-2024-53088\nlinux -- linux_kernel\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: io_uring/rw: fix missing NOWAIT check for O_DIRECT start write When io_uring starts a write, it'll call kiocb_start_write() to bump the super block rwsem, preventing any freezes from happening while that write is in-flight. The freeze side will grab that rwsem for writing, excluding any new writers from happening and waiting for existing writes to finish. But io_uring unconditionally uses kiocb_start_write(), which will block if someone is currently attempting to freeze the mount point. This causes a deadlock where freeze is waiting for previous writes to complete, but the previous writes cannot complete, as the task that is supposed to complete them is blocked waiting on starting a new write. This results in the following stuck trace showing that dependency with the write blocked starting a new write: task:fio state:D stack:0 pid:886 tgid:886 ppid:876 Call trace: __switch_to+0x1d8/0x348 __schedule+0x8e8/0x2248 schedule+0x110/0x3f0 percpu_rwsem_wait+0x1e8/0x3f8 __percpu_down_read+0xe8/0x500 io_write+0xbb8/0xff8 io_issue_sqe+0x10c/0x1020 io_submit_sqes+0x614/0x2110 __arm64_sys_io_uring_enter+0x524/0x1038 invoke_syscall+0x74/0x268 el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x160/0x238 do_el0_svc+0x44/0x60 el0_svc+0x44/0xb0 el0t_64_sync_handler+0x118/0x128 el0t_64_sync+0x168/0x170 INFO: task fsfreeze:7364 blocked for more than 15 seconds.

For normal issue where IOCB_NOWAIT would always be set, this returns -EAGAIN which will have io_uring core issue a blocking attempt of the write. That will in turn also get completions run, ensuring forward progress. Since freezing requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN in the first place, this isn't something that can be triggered by a regular user.2024-11-194.4CVE-2024-53052\nmaheshwaghmare -- copy_anything_to_clipboard\n\u00a0Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (XSS or 'Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Clipboard Team Copy Anything to Clipboard allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Copy Anything to Clipboard: from n/a through 4.0.3.2024-11-185.4CVE-2024-52419\nmoodle -- moodle\n\u00a0A vulnerability was found in Moodle.

Prior to version 6.1.9, the regex validation used to prevent Introspection queries can be bypassed by removing the extra whitespace, carriage return, and line feed characters from the query. GraphQL Queries in OpenCTI can be validated using the `secureIntrospectionPlugin`. The regex check in the plkugin can be bypassed by removing the carriage return and line feed characters (`\\r\\n`). Running a curl command against a local instance of OpenCTI will result in a limited error message. By running the same Introspection query without the `\\r\\n` characters, the unauthenticated user is able to successfully run a full Introspection query. Bypassing this restriction allows the attacker to gather a wealth of information about the GraphQL endpoint functionality that can be used to perform actions and/or read data without authorization. These queries can also be weaponized to conduct a Denial of Service (DoS) attack if sent repeatedly. Users should upgrade to version 6.1.9 to receive a patch for the issue.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-37155\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0An LDAP injection vulnerability in the login page of Gladinet CentreStack v13.12.9934.54690 allows attackers to access sensitive data or execute arbitrary commands via a crafted payload injected into the username field.2024-11-22not yet calculatedCVE-2024-37782\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Gladinet CentreStack v13.12.9934.54690 allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into the web browser of a victim via the sessionId parameter at /portal/ForgotPassword.aspx.2024-11-22not yet calculatedCVE-2024-37783\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Dell Edge Gateway 5200 (Coffee Lake S), versions prior to 12.0.94.2380, contains an Exposure of Sensitive Information in Shared Microarchitectural Structures during Transient Execution vulnerability.

The `XmlScanner` class has a scan method which should prevent XXE attacks. However, in a bypass of the previously reported `CVE-2024-47873`, the regexes from the `findCharSet` method, which is used for determining the current encoding can be bypassed by using a payload in the encoding UTF-7, and adding at end of the file a comment with the value `encoding=\"UTF-8\"` with `\"`, which is matched by the first regex, so that `encoding='UTF-7'` with single quotes `'` in the XML header is not matched by the second regex. An attacker can bypass the sanitizer and achieve an XML external entity attack.

When parsing hci reports, the hci parsing software dynamically determines the length of a list of reports by reading a byte from an input stream. It then fetches the length of the first report, uses it to calculate the beginning of the second report, etc. In doing this, it tracks the largest report so it can later allocate a buffer that fits every individual report (but only one at a time). It does not, however, validate that these addresses are all contained within the buffer passed to hciEvtProcessLeExtAdvReport. It is then possible, though unlikely, that the buffer designated to hold the reports is allocated in such a way that one of these out-of-bounds length fields is contained within the new buffer. When the (n-1)th report is copied, it overwrites the length field of the nth report. This now corrupted length field is then used for a memcpy into the new buffer, which may lead to a buffer overflow.2024-11-20not yet calculatedCVE-2024-48984\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Qualys discovered that needrestart, before version 3.8, allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code as root by tricking needrestart into running the Python interpreter with an attacker-controlled PYTHONPATH environment variable.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-48990\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Qualys discovered that needrestart, before version 3.8, allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code as root by winning a race condition and tricking needrestart into running their own, fake Python interpreter (instead of the system's real Python interpreter).2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-48991\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Qualys discovered that needrestart, before version 3.8, allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code as root by tricking needrestart into running the Ruby interpreter with an attacker-controlled RUBYLIB environment variable.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-48992\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) Spoofing Vulnerability2024-11-22not yet calculatedCVE-2024-49054\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Querydsl 5.1.0 and OpenFeign Querydsl 6.8 allows SQL/HQL injection in orderBy in JPAQuery.2024-11-20not yet calculatedCVE-2024-49203\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Multiple endpoints in `oracle-sidecar` in versions 0.347.0 to 0.543.0 were found to be vulnerable to SQL injections.2024-11-21not yet calculatedCVE-2024-49588\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Missing Authorization vulnerability in Rextheme WP VR allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.This issue affects WP VR: from n/a through 8.5.5.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-49680\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Missing Authorization vulnerability in Harmonic Design HD Quiz - Save Results Light allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.This issue affects HD Quiz - Save Results Light: from n/a through 0.5.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-49689\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Missing Authorization vulnerability in WP Sunshine Sunshine Photo Cart allows Exploiting Incorrectly Configured Access Control Security Levels.This issue affects Sunshine Photo Cart: from n/a through 3.2.9.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-49697\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0The back-end does not sufficiently verify the user-controlled filename parameter which makes it possible for an attacker to perform a path traversal attack and retrieve arbitrary files from the file system.2024-11-22not yet calculatedCVE-2024-50054\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: usb: musb: sunxi: Fix accessing an released usb phy Commit 6ed05c68cbca (\"usb: musb: sunxi: Explicitly release USB PHY on exit\") will cause that usb phy @glue->xceiv is accessed after released. 1) register platform driver @sunxi_musb_driver // get the usb phy @glue->xceiv sunxi_musb_probe() -> devm_usb_get_phy(). 2) register and unregister platform driver @musb_driver musb_probe() -> sunxi_musb_init() use the phy here //the phy is released here musb_remove() -> sunxi_musb_exit() -> devm_usb_put_phy() 3) register @musb_driver again musb_probe() -> sunxi_musb_init() use the phy here but the phy has been released at 2). ...

Specifically, 'score_goal_diff_bp' calculation can overflow when 'score' is high. The calculation is actually unnecessary at all because 'goal' is a constant of value 10,000. Calculation of 'compensation' is again fragile to overflow. Final calculation of return value for under-achiving case is again fragile to overflow when the current score is under-achieving the target. Add two corner cases handling at the beginning of the function to make the body easier to read, and rewrite the body of the function to avoid overflows and the unnecessary bp value calcuation.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-50270\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: signal: restore the override_rlimit logic Prior to commit d64696905554 (\"Reimplement RLIMIT_SIGPENDING on top of ucounts\") UCOUNT_RLIMIT_SIGPENDING rlimit was not enforced for a class of signals. However now it's enforced unconditionally, even if override_rlimit is set. This behavior change caused production issues. For example, if the limit is reached and a process receives a SIGSEGV signal, sigqueue_alloc fails to allocate the necessary resources for the signal delivery, preventing the signal from being delivered with siginfo. This prevents the process from correctly identifying the fault address and handling the error. From the user-space perspective, applications are unaware that the limit has been reached and that the siginfo is effectively 'corrupted'. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and crashes, as we observed with java applications. Fix this by passing override_rlimit into inc_rlimit_get_ucounts() and skip the comparison to max there if override_rlimit is set. This effectively restores the old behavior.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-50271\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: filemap: Fix bounds checking in filemap_read() If the caller supplies an iocb->ki_pos value that is close to the filesystem upper limit, and an iterator with a count that causes us to overflow that limit, then filemap_read() enters an infinite loop. This behaviour was discovered when testing xfstests generic/525 with the \"localio\" optimisation for loopback NFS mounts.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-50272\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: btrfs: reinitialize delayed ref list after deleting it from the list At insert_delayed_ref() if we need to update the action of an existing ref to BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF, we delete the ref from its ref head's ref_add_list using list_del(), which leaves the ref's add_list member not reinitialized, as list_del() sets the next and prev members of the list to LIST_POISON1 and LIST_POISON2, respectively. If later we end up calling drop_delayed_ref() against the ref, which can happen during merging or when destroying delayed refs due to a transaction abort, we can trigger a crash since at drop_delayed_ref() we call list_empty() against the ref's add_list, which returns false since the list was not reinitialized after the list_del() and as a consequence we call list_del() again at drop_delayed_ref(). This results in an invalid list access since the next and prev members are set to poison pointers, resulting in a splat if CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST are set or invalid poison pointer dereferences otherwise. So fix this by deleting from the list with list_del_init() instead.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-50273\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: idpf: avoid vport access in idpf_get_link_ksettings When the device control plane is removed or the platform running device control plane is rebooted, a reset is detected on the driver. On driver reset, it releases the resources and waits for the reset to complete. If the reset fails, it takes the error path and releases the vport lock. At this time if the monitoring tools tries to access link settings, it call traces for accessing released vport pointer. To avoid it, move link_speed_mbps to netdev_priv structure which removes the dependency on vport pointer and the vport lock in idpf_get_link_ksettings. Also use netif_carrier_ok() to check the link status and adjust the offsetof to use link_up instead of link_speed_mbps.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-50274\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: arm64/sve: Discard stale CPU state when handling SVE traps The logic for handling SVE traps manipulates saved FPSIMD/SVE state incorrectly, and a race with preemption can result in a task having TIF_SVE set and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE clear even though the live CPU state is stale (e.g. with SVE traps enabled). This has been observed to result in warnings from do_sve_acc() where SVE traps are not expected while TIF_SVE is set: | if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE)) | WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */ Warnings of this form have been reported intermittently, e.g. https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/CA+G9fYtEGe_DhY2Ms7+L7NKsLYUomGsgqpdBj+QwDLeSg=JhGg@mail.gmail.com/ https://lore.kernel.org/linux-arm-kernel/000000000000511e9a060ce5a45c@google.com/ The race can occur when the SVE trap handler is preempted before and after manipulating the saved FPSIMD/SVE state, starting and ending on the same CPU, e.g. | void do_sve_acc(unsigned long esr, struct pt_regs *regs) | { | // Trap on CPU 0 with TIF_SVE clear, SVE traps enabled | // task->fpsimd_cpu is 0. | // per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is task. | | ... | | // Preempted; migrated from CPU 0 to CPU 1. | // TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set. | | get_cpu_fpsimd_context(); | | if (test_and_set_thread_flag(TIF_SVE)) | WARN_ON(1); /* SVE access shouldn't have trapped */ | | sve_init_regs() { | if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE)) { | ... | } else { | fpsimd_to_sve(current); | current->thread.fp_type = FP_STATE_SVE; | } | } | | put_cpu_fpsimd_context(); | | // Preempted; migrated from CPU 1 to CPU 0. | // task->fpsimd_cpu is still 0 | // If per_cpu_ptr(&fpsimd_last_state, 0) is still task then: | // - Stale HW state is reused (with SVE traps enabled) | // - TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is cleared | // - A return to userspace skips HW state restore | } Fix the case where the state is not live and TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE is set by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state() to detach from the saved CPU state. This ensures that a subsequent context switch will not reuse the stale CPU state, and will instead set TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE, forcing the new state to be reloaded from memory prior to a return to userspace.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-50275\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dm: fix a crash if blk_alloc_disk fails If blk_alloc_disk fails, the variable md->disk is set to an error value. cleanup_mapped_device will see that md->disk is non-NULL and it will attempt to access it, causing a crash on this statement \"md->disk->private_data = NULL;\".2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-50277\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: dm cache: fix potential out-of-bounds access on the first resume Out-of-bounds access occurs if the fast device is expanded unexpectedly before the first-time resume of the cache table.

An authorized administrator with access to change logging levels could enable debug logging for framework flow synchronization, causing the application to write Parameter names and values to the application log. Parameter Context values may contain sensitive information depending on application flow configuration. Deployments of Apache NiFi with the default Logback configuration do not log Parameter Context values.

Similarly, the documentation did not take this into consideration either. Given a provider with the Redirect URIs set to https://foo.example.com, an attacker can register a domain fooaexample.com, and it will correctly pass validation. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. As a workaround, When configuring OAuth2 providers, make sure to escape any wildcard characters that are not intended to function as a wildcard, for example replace `.` with `\\.`.2024-11-21not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52289\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. In versions starting with 3.10.6 and prior to 3.10.11, a memory leak can occur when a request produces a MatchInfoError. This was caused by adding an entry to a cache on each request, due to the building of each MatchInfoError producing a unique cache entry. An attacker may be able to exhaust the memory resources of a server by sending a substantial number (100,000s to millions) of such requests. Those who use any middlewares with aiohttp.web should upgrade to version 3.10.11 to receive a patch.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52303\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. Prior to version 3.10.11, the Python parser parses newlines in chunk extensions incorrectly which can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions. If a pure Python version of aiohttp is installed (i.e. without the usual C extensions) or `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS` is enabled, then an attacker may be able to execute a request smuggling attack to bypass certain firewalls or proxy protections. Version 3.10.11 fixes the issue.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52304\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0authentik is an open-source identity provider. Due to the usage of a non-constant time comparison for the /-/metrics/ endpoint it was possible to brute-force the SECRET_KEY, which is used to authenticate the endpoint. The /-/metrics/ endpoint returns Prometheus metrics and is not intended to be accessed directly, as the Go proxy running in the authentik server container fetches data from this endpoint and serves it on a separate port (9300 by default), which can be scraped by Prometheus without being exposed publicly. authentik 2024.8.5 and 2024.10.3 fix this issue. Since the /-/metrics/ endpoint is not intended to be accessed publicly, requests to the endpoint can be blocked by the reverse proxy/load balancer used in conjunction with authentik.2024-11-21not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52307\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0SFTPGo is a full-featured and highly configurable SFTP, HTTP/S, FTP/S and WebDAV server - S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob. One powerful feature of SFTPGo is the ability to have the EventManager execute scripts or run applications in response to certain events. This feature is very common in all software similar to SFTPGo and is generally unrestricted. However, any SFTPGo administrator with permission to run a script has access to the underlying OS/container with the same permissions as the user running SFTPGo. This is unexpected for some SFTPGo administrators who think that there is a clear distinction between accessing the system shell and accessing the SFTPGo WebAdmin UI. To avoid this confusion, running system commands is disabled by default in 2.6.3, and an allow list has been added so that system administrators configuring SFTPGo must explicitly define which commands are allowed to be configured from the WebAdmin UI.2024-11-21not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52309\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Unchecked Error Condition vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.

The reporting functionality in Graylog allows the creation and scheduling of reports which contain dashboard widgets displaying individual log messages or metrics aggregated from fields of multiple log messages. This functionality, as included in Graylog 6.1.0 & 6.1.1, is vulnerable to information leakage triggered by multiple concurrent report rendering requests from authorized users. When multiple report renderings are requested at the same start time, the headless browser instance used to render the PDF will be reused. Depending on the timing, either a check for the browser instance \"freshness\" hits, resulting in an error instead of the report being returned, or one of the concurrent report rendering requests \"wins\" and this report is returned for all report rendering requests that do not return an error. This might lead to one user getting the report of a different user, potentially leaking indexed log messages or aggregated data that this user normally has no access to. This problem is fixed in Graylog 6.1.2. There is no known workaround besides disabling the reporting functionality.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52506\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Cachi2 is a command-line interface tool that pre-fetches a project's dependencies to aid in making the project's build process network-isolated.

Versions prior to 5.4.1 are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting due to improper headers in direct access to uploaded SVGs. The application allows uploading images in several places. One of the accepted types of image is SVG, which allows JS scripting. Therefore, by uploading a malicious SVG which contains JS code, an attacker which is able to drive a victim to the uploaded image could compromise that victim's session and access to their tokens. Version 5.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.2024-11-20not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52597\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a02FAuth is a web app to manage Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) accounts and generate their security codes. Two interconnected vulnerabilities exist in version 5.4.1 a SSRF and URI validation bypass issue. The endpoint at POST /api/v1/twofaccounts/preview allows setting a remote URI to retrieve the image of a 2fa site. By abusing this functionality, it is possible to force the application to make a GET request to an arbitrary URL, whose content will be stored in an image file in the server if it looks like an image. Additionally, the library does some basic validation on the URI, attempting to filter our URIs which do not have an image extension. However, this can be easily bypassed by appending the string `#.svg` to the URI. The combination of these two issues allows an attacker to retrieve URIs accessible from the application, as long as their content type is text based. If not, the request is still sent, but the response is not reflected to the attacker. Version 5.4.1 fixes the issues.2024-11-20not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52598\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Statmatic is a Laravel and Git powered content management system (CMS).

First noticed in Opencast 13 and 14, Opencast's Elasticsearch integration may generate syntactically invalid Elasticsearch queries in relation to previously acceptable search queries. From Opencast version 11.4 and newer, Elasticsearch queries are retried a configurable number of times in the case of error to handle temporary losses of connection to Elasticsearch. These invalid queries would fail, causing the retry mechanism to begin requerying with the same syntactically invalid query immediately, in an infinite loop. This causes a massive increase in log size which can in some cases cause a denial of service due to disk exhaustion. Opencast 13.10 and Opencast 14.3 contain patches which address the base issue, with Opencast 16.7 containing changes which harmonize the search behaviour between the admin UI and external API. Users are strongly recommended to upgrade as soon as possible if running versions prior to 13.10 or 14.3. While the relevant endpoints require (by default) `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_API_SERIES_VIEW`, the problem queries are otherwise innocuous. This issue could be easily triggered by normal administrative work on an affected Opencast system. Those who run a version newer than 13.10 and 14.3 and see different results when searching in their admin UI vs your external API or LMS, may resolve the issue by upgrading to 16.7. No known workarounds for the vulnerability are available.2024-11-21not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52797\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Argo Workflows Chart is used to set up argo and its needed dependencies through one command.

If a user can be made to run a malicious template, their whole namespace can be compromised. This affects versions of the argo-workflows Chart that use appVersion: 3.4 and above, which no longer need these permissions for the only available Executor, Emissary. It could also affect users below 3.4 depending on their choice of Executor in those versions. This only affects the Helm Chart and not the upstream manifests.

The issue is caused by insecure usage of the `Popen` function with `shell=True`, coupled with unsanitized user input. Immediate remediation is required to mitigate the risk. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.9.1.2024-11-21not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52803\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library. The algorithm used for parsing HTTP cookies in Tornado versions prior to 6.4.2 sometimes has quadratic complexity, leading to excessive CPU consumption when parsing maliciously-crafted cookie headers. This parsing occurs in the event loop thread and may block the processing of other requests. Version 6.4.2 fixes the issue.2024-11-22not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52804\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Argo Helm is a collection of community maintained charts for `argoproj.github.io` projects. Prior to version 0.45.0, the `workflow-role`) lacks granularity in its privileges, giving permissions to `workflowtasksets` and `workflowartifactgctasks` to all workflow Pods, when only certain types of Pods created by the Controller require these privileges. The impact is minimal, as an attack could only affect status reporting for certain types of Pods and templates. Version 0.45.0 fixes the issue.2024-11-22not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52814\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Bitcoin Core before 0.21.0 allows a network split that is resultant from an integer overflow (calculating the time offset for newly connecting peers) and an abs64 logic bug.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52912\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In Bitcoin Core before 0.21.0, an attacker could prevent a node from seeing a specific unconfirmed transaction, because transaction re-requests are mishandled.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52913\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In Bitcoin Core before 0.18.0, a node could be stalled for hours when processing the orphans of a crafted unconfirmed transaction.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52914\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Bitcoin Core before 0.20.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted INV message.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52915\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Bitcoin Core before 0.15.0 allows a denial of service (OOM kill of a daemon process) via a flood of minimum difficulty headers.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52916\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Bitcoin Core before 22.0 has a miniupnp infinite loop in which it allocates memory on the basis of random data received over the network, e.g., large M-SEARCH replies from a fake UPnP device.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52917\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Bitcoin-Qt in Bitcoin Core before 0.20.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and application crash) via a BIP21 r parameter for a URL that has a large file.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52918\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Bitcoin Core before 22.0 has a CAddrMan nIdCount integer overflow and resultant assertion failure (and daemon exit) via a flood of addr messages.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52919\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Bitcoin Core before 0.20.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a malformed GETDATA message.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52920\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In Bitcoin Core before 25.0, a peer can affect the download state of other peers by sending a mutated block.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52921\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In Bitcoin Core before 25.1, an attacker can cause a node to not download the latest block, because there can be minutes of delay when an announcing peer stalls instead of complying with the peer-to-peer protocol specification.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52922\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0Delinea Privilege Manager before 12.0.2 mishandles the security of the Windows agent.2024-11-18not yet calculatedCVE-2024-52926\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0AnyDesk through 8.1.0 on Windows, when Allow Direct Connections is enabled, inadvertently exposes a public IP address within network traffic.

[ side note, I don't think it even failed prior to commit 913b47d3424e (\"net/sched: Introduce tc block netdev tracking infra\"), because this is a command from an old set of notes of mine which used to work, but alas, I did not scientifically bisect this ] The problem is not that it fails, but rather, that the second time around, it fails differently (and irrecoverably): $ tc qdisc replace dev eth0 ingress_block 1 egress_block 1 clsact Error: dsa_core: Flow block cb is busy. [ another note: the extack is added by me for illustration purposes. the context of the problem is that clsact_init() obtains the same &q->ingress_block pointer as &q->egress_block, and since we call tcf_block_get_ext() on both of them, \"dev\" will be added to the block->ports xarray twice, thus failing the operation: once through the ingress block pointer, and once again through the egress block pointer. the problem itself is that when xa_insert() fails, we have emitted a FLOW_BLOCK_BIND command through ndo_setup_tc(), but the offload never sees a corresponding FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND. ] Even correcting the bad user input, we still cannot recover: $ tc qdisc replace dev swp3 ingress_block 1 egress_block 2 clsact Error: dsa_core: Flow block cb is busy. Basically the only way to recover is to reboot the system, or unbind and rebind the net device driver. To fix the bug, we need to fill the correct error teardown path which was missed during code movement, and call tcf_block_offload_unbind() when xa_insert() fails. [ last note, fundamentally I blame the label naming convention in tcf_block_get_ext() for the bug. The labels should be named after what they do, not after the error path that jumps to them. This way, it is obviously wrong that two labels pointing to the same code mean something is wrong, and checking the code correctness at the goto site is also easier ]2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-53044\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: ASoC: dapm: fix bounds checker error in dapm_widget_list_create The widgets array in the snd_soc_dapm_widget_list has a __counted_by attribute attached to it, which points to the num_widgets variable.

For mapping DRM_PANTHOR_USER_FLUSH_ID_MMIO_OFFSET, panthor_device_mmap_io() bails if VM_WRITE is set, but does not clear VM_MAYWRITE. That means userspace can use mprotect() to make the mapping writable later on. This is a classic Linux driver gotcha. I don't think this actually has any impact in practice: When the GPU is powered, writes to the FLUSH_ID seem to be ignored; and when the GPU is not powered, the dummy_latest_flush page provided by the driver is deliberately designed to not do any flushes, so the only thing writing to the dummy_latest_flush could achieve would be to make *more* flushes happen. 2. panthor_device_mmap_io() does not block MAP_PRIVATE mappings (which are mappings without the VM_SHARED flag). MAP_PRIVATE in combination with VM_MAYWRITE indicates that the VMA has copy-on-write semantics, which for VM_PFNMAP are semi-supported but fairly cursed. In particular, in such a mapping, the driver can only install PTEs during mmap() by calling remap_pfn_range() (because remap_pfn_range() wants to **store the physical address of the mapped physical memory into the vm_pgoff of the VMA**); installing PTEs later on with a fault handler (as panthor does) is not supported in private mappings, and so if you try to fault in such a mapping, vmf_insert_pfn_prot() splats when it hits a BUG() check. Fix it by clearing the VM_MAYWRITE flag (userspace writing to the FLUSH_ID doesn't make sense) and requiring VM_SHARED (copy-on-write semantics for the FLUSH_ID don't make sense). Reproducers for both scenarios are in the notes of my patch on the mailing list; I tested that these bugs exist on a Rock 5B machine. Note that I only compile-tested the patch, I haven't tested it; I don't have a working kernel build setup for the test machine yet. Please test it before applying it.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-53071\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm/thp: fix deferred split unqueue naming and locking Recent changes are putting more pressure on THP deferred split queues: under load revealing long-standing races, causing list_del corruptions, \"Bad page state\"s and worse (I keep BUGs in both of those, so usually don't get to see how badly they end up without). The relevant recent changes being 6.8's mTHP, 6.10's mTHP swapout, and 6.12's mTHP swapin, improved swap allocation, and underused THP splitting. Before fixing locking: rename misleading folio_undo_large_rmappable(), which does not undo large_rmappable, to folio_unqueue_deferred_split(), which is what it does. But that and its out-of-line __callee are mm internals of very limited usability: add comment and WARN_ON_ONCEs to check usage; and return a bool to say if a deferred split was unqueued, which can then be used in WARN_ON_ONCEs around safety checks (sparing callers the arcane conditionals in __folio_unqueue_deferred_split()). Just omit the folio_unqueue_deferred_split() from free_unref_folios(), all of whose callers now call it beforehand (and if any forget then bad_page() will tell) - except for its caller put_pages_list(), which itself no longer has any callers (and will be deleted separately). Swapout: mem_cgroup_swapout() has been resetting folio->memcg_data 0 without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from deferred split list; which is unfortunate, since the split_queue_lock depends on the memcg (when memcg is enabled); so swapout has been unqueueing such THPs later, when freeing the folio, using the pgdat's lock instead: potentially corrupting the memcg's list. __remove_mapping() has frozen refcount to 0 here, so no problem with calling folio_unqueue_deferred_split() before resetting memcg_data. That goes back to 5.4 commit 87eaceb3faa5 (\"mm: thp: make deferred split shrinker memcg aware\"): which included a check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue, but no check on deferred queue before adding THP to swapcache. That worked fine with the usual sequence of events in reclaim (though there were a couple of rare ways in which a THP on deferred queue could have been swapped out), but 6.12 commit dafff3f4c850 (\"mm: split underused THPs\") avoids splitting underused THPs in reclaim, which makes swapcache THPs on deferred queue commonplace. Keep the check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue? Yes: it is no longer essential, but preserves the existing behaviour, and is likely to be a worthwhile optimization (vmstat showed much more traffic on the queue under swapping load if the check was removed); update its comment. Memcg-v1 move (deprecated): mem_cgroup_move_account() has been changing folio->memcg_data without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from the deferred list, sometimes corrupting \"from\" memcg's list, like swapout. Refcount is non-zero here, so folio_unqueue_deferred_split() can only be used in a WARN_ON_ONCE to validate the fix, which must be done earlier: mem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() first try to split the THP (splitting of course unqueues), or skip it if that fails. Not ideal, but moving charge has been requested, and khugepaged should repair the THP later: nobody wants new custom unqueueing code just for this deprecated case. The 87eaceb3faa5 commit did have the code to move from one deferred list to another (but was not conscious of its unsafety while refcount non-0); but that was removed by 5.6 commit fac0516b5534 (\"mm: thp: don't need care deferred split queue in memcg charge move path\"), which argued that the existence of a PMD mapping guarantees that the THP cannot be on a deferred list. As above, false in rare cases, and now commonly false. Backport to 6.11 should be straightforward. Earlier backports must take care that other _deferred_list fixes and dependencies are included. There is not a strong case for backports, but they can fix cornercases.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-53079\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: drm/panthor: Lock XArray when getting entries for the VM Similar to commit cac075706f29 (\"drm/panthor: Fix race when converting group handle to group object\") we need to use the XArray's internal locking when retrieving a vm pointer from there. v2: Removed part of the patch that was trying to protect fetching the heap pointer from XArray, as that operation is protected by the @pool->lock.2024-11-19not yet calculatedCVE-2024-53080\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: media: ar0521: don't overflow when checking PLL values The PLL checks are comparing 64 bit integers with 32 bit ones, as reported by Coverity.

Recently, we got a customer report that CIFS triggers oops while reconnecting to a server. [0] The workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers in non-root network namespaces. The problem rarely happened, but it was always while the pod was dying. The root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace. CIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that the socket belongs to. That means CIFS must ensure the socket is always freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens. The repro steps are roughly: 1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns 2. drop packets from the netns 3. destroy the netns 4. unmount CIFS We can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see the splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled. When the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime without holding refcnt due to async timers. Let's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit 9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\"). Note that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to clean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a freed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread(). Also, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because the code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same address happened to be reallocated to another netns.

Version 24.11.0, and only version 24.11.0, is vulnerable to a scenario where a specific error message generated by the Sentry platform could include a plaintext Client ID and Client Secret for an application integration. The Client ID and Client Secret would not be displayed in the UI, but would be returned in the underlying HTTP response to the end user. This could occur under the following conditions: An app installation made use of a Search UI component with the `async` flag set to true (default: true); auser types types into the Search Component which creates a request to the third-party for search or query results; and that third-party response may then fail validation and Sentry would return the `select-requester.invalid-response` error code along with a serialized version of a Sentry application containing the integration Client Secret. Should this error be found, it's reasonable to assume the potential exposure of an integration Client Secret. However, an ID and Secret pair alone does not provide direct access to any data. For that secret to be abused an attacker would also need to obtain a valid API token for a Sentry application. Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. For Sentry SaaS users, only a single application integration was impacted and the owner has rotated their Client Secret. No abuse of the leaked Client Secret has occurred. As of time of publication, a fix is available for users of Sentry self-hosted in pull request 81038. Sentry self-hosted does not ship with any application integrations. This could only impact self-hosted users that maintain their own integrations. In that case, search for a `select-requester.invalid-response` event. Please note that this error was also shared with another event unrelated to this advisory so Sentry self-hosted users will also need to review the parameters logged for each named event. Sentry self-hosted users may review `select_requester.py` for the instances where these errors can be generated. With the security fix this is no longer a shared event type. Sentry self-hosted users may not install version 24.11.0 and instead wait for the next release. Self-hosted instance that are already running the affected version may consider downgrading to to 24.10.0.2024-11-22not yet calculatedCVE-2024-53253\nn/a -- n/a\n\u00a0TOTOLINK EX200 v4.0.3c.7646_B20201211 was found to contain a command insertion vulnerability in the setUssd function.

        "Description": "This study, based on Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Lent et al., 1994, 2000), investigated the role of familial support in the STEM career development of Asian American college students. Participants included 446 first-year undergraduate students who identified as Asian or Asian American and had not declared an academic major. Due to multicollinearity, four initial familial support variables\u2014instrumental assistance, career-related modeling, verbal encouragement, and emotional support\u2014were regrouped into two: performance motivation (instrumental assistance and verbal encouragement) and career mentoring (career-related modeling and emotional support). Structural equation modeling showed acceptable fit for a modified model, and the results partially supported the hypothesized paths. Findings indicated that career mentoring, but not performance motivation, was directly and positively associated with STEM coping self-efficacy. No direct relation was found between the support variables and STEM outcome expectations, but career mentoring indirectly influenced outcome expectations through enhanced coping self-efficacy. Neither STEM coping self-efficacy nor outcome expectations had significant direct relations with STEM interest. Performance motivation, but not STEM interest, was directly related to STEM goals. Participants\u2019 generation status was controlled for in all structural analyses. Gender could not be tested as a moderator due to anomalies in the gender analyses, which prevented a credible interpretation of findings related to gender differences. Due to the unique characteristics of the present sample recruited for this study, caution was implicated in interpreting the results and recommending future research. Despite the limitations, the results provided some suggestions about how mental health professionals and educators might develop more effective interventions to support Asian and Asian American students in their pursuit of STEM careers.",

Twelve interviews were conducted with six non-binary individuals ranging in age from 23 to 33. Each interview was analyzed and coded, resulting in four superordinate themes: The Experience of Enbyphobia, The Impact of Enbyphobia, The Expression of Enbyphobia, and The Perpetuation of Enbyphobia. Each superordinate theme contains between three and five subthemes. Implications for research, theory, and practice are discussed.",

        "Description": "Previous research on the immigrant health paradox among children and adolescents show a mental health advantage yet it is unclear if this applies in a similar magnitude to females (Fillion et al., 2018; Zarei et al., 2023). Immigrants may be exposed to stressors related to immigration and acculturation. Some research suggests that females respond more to stress through internalizing symptoms relative to males (Hall-Lande et al., 2007; Adkins et al., 2009). Given these gender differences in stress response, female immigrants may be particularly vulnerable to the psychological consequences of immigration related stressors. The immigrant health paradox has also overlooked subjective measures of body weight such as body image which may provide insight into how immigrants adjust to a new context. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, this study explores whether overestimating weight and depressive symptoms differ by nativity status among Asian and Hispanic female adolescents. The findings show no evidence that Asian and Hispanic female\u2019s depressive symptoms differ by nativity status nor was there any evidence that overestimating weight differs by nativity status among these subgroups. In sum, this study provides an estimate of how ethnicity and nativity status affect body image and depressive symptoms across U.S. adolescent females. The findings contribute to our understanding of the immigrant health paradox and suggest that it is not applicable to all health outcomes.",

        "Description": "Spotted Lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) is an invasive treehopper native to Asia. It was first introduced to Pennsylvania in 2014, and as of 2020 it has expanded to New York state. Their preferred host tree is the invasive tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), but they will feed on over 173 different plants worldwide. Preferred host species in New York state include agricultural vegetation such as grape vines and fruit trees. Positive Spotted Lanternfly site data collected by the New York Department of Agriculture and Markets and iMapInvasives were analyzed using ArcGIS Pro to assess spatial distribution patterns. Spotted Lanternfly egg masses can be unknowingly spread via transportation pathways such as highways and railroads. Using a multi-scale geographically weighted regression, proximity to these pathways and tree of heaven presence were shown to be significant factors in the location of spotted lanternfly sightings in New York state. Additionally, infestation risk was geographically categorized based on proximity to these transportation pathways and agricultural regions.",

        "Description": "The prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been steadily increasing for the past several decades, with recent estimates indicating that 1 in 36 children in the United States have an ASD diagnosis (Maenner et al., 2023). As this condition is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, with a strong evidence base supporting early identification, intervention and parenting practices to promote social communication development, a large portion of the research has focused on identifying characteristics of parent-child interactions amongst this population and determining how best to intervene on the family level to promote the development of these skills (Ku et al., 2019). There have been a variety of tools developed to achieve this goal, but there is a strong need for an observational behavioral coding system that has been standardized across neurotypical and autistic populations, as this would best facilitate comparisons of parent-child interactions across these populations. The current study sought to investigate a tool with that potential. Specifically, this exploratory study sought to identify the parent and child characteristics that are related to behaviors coded for using the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System, Fourth Edition (Eyberg et al., 2013). Additionally, this study sought to identify whether there were differences between in-person and virtual observations of the parent-child interactions. Results indicated that no differences were observed between the virtual and in-person observations of the parent-child interactions in the study. There were several parent and child characteristics that were correlated with specific parent and child interactive behaviors. Strengths and limitations of the study, as well as its implications for future research, are discussed.",

        "Description": "Quinary interactions arise due to the extreme macromolecular crowding inside live cells. Quinary interactions affect intracellular protein stability, activity, and homeostasis. Ribosomes, traditionally known for their role in protein synthesis, have been found to engage in quinary interactions with metabolic enzymes, modulating their activity and thereby revealing a potential regulatory role for ribosomes in cellular metabolism. This phenomenon, termed the Ribosome-Amplified MetaBOlism (RAMBO) effect, was investigated in this dissertation through a series of in vitro and in vivo studies using primarily Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\nFirstly, an NMR-based direct enzyme assay compatible with ribosome was developed and validated using pyruvate kinase (PYK) from Bacillus stearothermophilus as a probe. A high-quality Escherichia coli 70S ribosomes preparation was developed. Highly purified ribosomes were used to ensure that the observed amplification in enzyme activity was solely attributable to ribosomal interactions. Ribosomes were shown to significantly enhance the PYK activity and chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) was used to identify key ribosomal binding sites of PYK, supporting the RAMBO effect.\nNext, a general mechanism for the RAMBO effect was proposed and elucidated, where the ribosome external electric field (EEF)-substrate dipole interaction energy stabilizes transition states, significantly increasing the activity of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) from Gallus gallus. NMR spectroscopy was performed to examine the quinary interaction surface of TPI binding to the ribosomes, and to access the TPI kinetic assay. XL-MS coupled with molecular docking were used to determine the potential TPI-ribosome binding conformations, providing structural models for the electric fields and substrate dipoles calculations. Ribosomal protein L11 was identified as the primary binding partner of TPI, confirming the origin of the RAMBO effect.\nFinally, the in vivo RAMBO effect was studied in the context of glycolysis in E. coli using real-time pulse chase (RTPC)-NMR. The activity of pyruvate kinase I (PYFK) from E. coli was significantly enhanced in the presence of ribosomes, but this ribosome-mediated amplification was disrupted by the addition of ribosomal antibiotics in vitro. Kinetic flux profiling (KFP) further demonstrated the RAMBO effect observed in vitro also occurs in live cells, thereby confirming the role of ribosomes metabolic regulation and validating the RAMBO hypothesis.",

        "Description": "There is an urgent need for rapid and on-site analytical methods to address various environmental and forensic challenges. This dissertation explores the application of Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning for three critical areas: evaluating perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure in wildlife, authenticating tuna species in the seafood industry, identifying body fluids at crime scenes, and medical diagnostics.\nFirst, Raman spectroscopy and support vector machine discriminant analysis (SVMDA) were employed to detect PFAS levels in the blood plasma of smallmouth bass from two different tributaries, rivers, or streams that flow into larger bodies of water. The method achieved 100% accuracy in differentiating between samples containing either low or high PFAS concentrations, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool for fish health.\nSecond, the capability of Raman spectroscopy to authenticate three commonly sold tuna species\u2014yellowfin, bluefin, and escolar was assessed. The developed method accurately identified the species using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), demonstrating its value as a quality control tool in the seafood industry to prevent fraudulent labeling.\nThird, Raman spectroscopy combined with Random Forest machine learning was utilized to identify six main body fluids and distinguish them from 49 potential environmental interferences that may be discovered at crime scenes. The method achieved 100% accuracy in external validation, indicating its effectiveness as a rapid, non-destructive technique for body fluid detection, which is crucial for criminal investigations.\nLastly, the detection of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) was explored using a novel screening method combining Raman spectroscopy with deep learning, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to analyze blood plasma. The ANN model demonstrated high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in distinguishing between moderate AD patients and healthy controls. This integrative approach offers a promising, non-invasive, rapid, and accurate screening method for early AD detection, potentially enhancing diagnostic capabilities and paving the way for earlier and more effective therapeutic interventions.\nOverall, this research showcases the versatility and efficacy of Raman spectroscopy and machine learning in providing reliable, accurate, and rapid analysis across different fields. Thus offering significant advancements in environmental monitoring, food authentication, and forensic science.",

        "Description": "The synthetic methods for rechargeable battery cathodes are rapidly evolving along with the continuous advancement of the materials themselves. Utilizing precursors for the synthesis of Li- and Na-ion cathode materials are known to ensure a phase-pure product with isotropic element distribution, thereby further enhancing the electrochemical properties of the cathode material. As more cathode materials with complex compositions continue to emerge, the strategies for designing the corresponding precursors are also getting diversified. One of the most promising directions is the employment of single-source precursors (SSPs), defined as molecules that contain all necessary elements in the proper ratio and decomposable under mild conditions to yield phase-pure target compounds upon the low-temperature decomposition. This method both optimizes the synthetic pathways to existing materials and provides an access to new materials that are not accessible by conventional techniques.\nIn this dissertation, the advancement of multiple SSPs through appropriate methods with delicate design steps is described. In general, this work contributes to developing new preparation techniques for prospective Li- and Na-ion metal oxides for rechargeable batteries, as well as to applying the SSP approach to synthesize and characterize unknown materials. At the same time, this thesis provides a detailed analysis of the structure and properties of different SSPs and highlights some unusual cases of isomerism. The isomerization phenomenon not only alter the precursor design approach but also affects the thermal decomposition properties related to the synthesis of target materials.",

        "Description": "In senescence that occurs with aging, cells stop dividing and initiate a pro-inflammatory program called the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP can lead to cell damage and has been linked to age-related conditions such as cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and osteoarthritis. The epitranscriptome regulates translation through post-transcriptional RNA modifications and can control when and how much of protein synthesis occurs. Several tRNA modifications that include 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5U), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U), and mcm5Um (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2\u2032-O-methyluridine) are linked to the translation of enzymes involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and defects in these tRNA modifications have been shown to promote senescence. We examined the reprogramming of tRNA modifications in response to pharmaceuticals that limit senescence or SASP in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and human lung fibroblast (IMR-90) cells. These cells were treated with senolytics (Navitoclax and Quercetin) and senomorphs (Metformin and Taurine). Small RNA was purified to analyze tRNA modifications by LC-MS/MS. We have demonstrated that senolytics and senomorphs can re-program tRNA modifications in wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts, specifically 5-methylthio-2-methyluracil (s2mo5U), 7-methylguanosine (m7G), 5-methylcytosine-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U), 2\u2019-O-methylguanosine (Gm), N1-Methyladenosine (m1A), and 5-methoxyuridine (mo5U). We have also demonstrated that senolytics and senomorphs can re-program tRNA modifications in senescent human lung fibroblasts, specifically 7-methylguanosine (m7G), 1-methylguanosine (m1G), N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m22G), 2-methylguanosine (m2G), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), N6-methyladenosine (m6Am), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5U), 2-thiocytidine (s2C), and pseudouridine (\u03a8), with our studies being some of the first to explore this hypothesis. Our studies highlight the potential of using senolytic and senomorphic therapeutic agents to treat tRNA-related diseases.",

        "Description": "Video self-modeling (VSM) is an intervention based on Bandura\u2019s (1999) theory of observational learning, which assumes that children learn a target behavior by observing a more competent model. VSM is assumed to provide an effective model from which children can learn given that the learner and model are the same person but differ only in their skills. More recently, studies have explored the effectiveness of VSM as an intervention for oral reading fluency (ORF) and showed promising results. Goal setting (GS) is another intervention that has been found to be effective in increasing students\u2019 performance by motivating them to meet their goal and self-monitor their progress.\nThe current study aimed to expand the existing reading intervention literature by evaluating the effectiveness of VSM as a standalone intervention as well as the additive effect of integrating GS with VSM on ORF. The hypotheses were that VSM alone would be effective in increasing students\u2019 ORF and that adding GS to VSM would further enhance the effectiveness of VSM. The participants were four general education students in third grade who were identified as needing additional reading support due to performing below grade level expectations based on their school\u2019s multi-tier systems of support (MTSS) universal reading assessment. All students were concurrently receiving small group reading interventions from their school.\nA multiple-baseline design across participants was used with each participant being exposed to four phases in the following order: 1) baseline, 2) VSM, 3) VSM with GS, and 4) maintenance. To analyze the results, a combination of visual analysis, in accordance with the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC; Kratochwill et al., 2010) standards, and hierarchical linear modeling, was utilized.\nConsistent with previous studies, the results showed that VSM alone was associated with an increase in words correct per minute (WCPM) where the four participants averaged an increase of 8.5 WCPM (Range\u0394 = 2.00 - 14.20) compared to baseline. Additionally, the additive effect of GS when combined with VSM produced an additional average increase of 10.37 WCPM (Range\u0394= 2.63 \u2013 18.67) across participants. Despite this increase in average ORF performance, the results of the visual analysis revealed inconsistent immediate effects and trends, as well as high variability and overlap across phases and participants. Therefore, the interventions did not demonstrate sufficient intervention effects to support their effectiveness based on the WWC criteria. The results from the HLM analysis supported the visual analysis as they revealed treatment effects that lacked statistical significance. A discussion of the interpretation, implications, and limitations of the results as well as future directions is provided.",

        "Description": "Objectives: The widespread availability of mindfulness-based practices has led to growing concern about the potential for misuse, namely the use of such practices as a control-based strategy rather than in an acceptance-based manner consistent with research. Thus, the present study aimed to elucidate factors (e.g., mode of instruction, meditation experience, psychological [in]flexibility [PF/PI]) that may relate to intentions guiding meditation use. Methods: Self-taught (ST) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) meditators (N = 122, Mage = 46.54, SDage = 16.49, 65.6% Female) completed a battery of measures assessing meditation intentions (control- or acceptance-based), meditation experience (in months), PF/PI, psychological distress, and satisfaction with life. Results: Control-based intentions covaried with worse psychological outcomes while acceptance-based intentions covaried with better outcomes. Meditation intentions and outcomes did not discriminate between ST and MBSR groups. Yet, satisfaction with life was significantly greater in the MBSR group relative to the ST group. PF fully mediated relations between meditation experience and acceptance-based intentions, whereas PI fully mediated relations between meditation experience and control-based intentions. Conclusion: Meditation experience, rather than mode of instruction, appears to influence whether meditation is used in an acceptance- or control-based context. Mediational findings suggest that such relations work through PF/PI processes. Longitudinal research is needed to evaluate whether meditation intentions change over time and the extent to which such changes influence the acceptability and utility of meditation itself.",

        "Description": "Breast cancer is a complex disease that continues to haunt women and their loved ones around the world. It is currently the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women. While most breast cancer patients can catch the disease before progression, others are less fortunate. The prognosis of those whose disease has advanced to metastatic or invasive breast cancer (IBC) is grim. Metastasis occurs when cancer cells undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), migrate to distant body tissues, then form new tumors. It is imperative to better understand the process of EMT to develop superior ways to detect breast cancer before becoming metastatic. Recently, post-transcriptional modifications have been implicated in the regulation of EMT in different cancer types. Previous studies lead us to believe that N4-actylcytidine may be involved in the process of EMT in human breast cancer. N4-actylcytidine (ac4C) is produced by the enzyme N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10). To establish an understanding of ac4C\u2019s role, we conducted several experiments while altering the expression of NAT10 in Human Mammary Epithelial (HMLE) cells. In this study, we show that the overexpression of NAT10 in HMLE cells induces certain characteristics of the mesenchymal phenotype. We also confirm a proposed method of ac4C-seq by confirming one N4-acetylcytidine site (C-1842) on the 18S ribosome of HMLE cells. These results help us to better understand the role of ac4C in the process of EMT in human breast cancer which may help to pave the way for better preventative interventions and treatments for patients with metastatic breast cancer.",

We found that emphasizing that MSM are most at risk increases support for policies that would restrict lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/-sexual, queer or questioning\u2013related events by about 7 percentage points compared with the control condition. However, the message describing African origins did not affect support for restricting travel from Africa. Neither changed risk perceptions or willingness to be vaccinated against mpox.\nConclusions.

This document reports on the interview component of the project.\nThese are the main highlights from the interviews.  \n Interviews were conducted primarily between February 2022 and July 2023, and included 38 full length conversations with town supervisors and village mayors.\n Access to local food varies, but food insecurity is generally considered to be an insignificant problem for most localities.\n Local food production in New York State continues to decline. There are fewer small farms, and many town officials consider the loss of small farms an issue of concern.\n Local food systems projects are rarely prioritized. However, as many food systems projects, such as pantries, community gardens and farmers markets are either low cost or have wider community benefits, they have proliferated. And these activities are often highlighted as important opportunities to build social capital.\n Collaboration matters. Having the structural mechanisms to support robust and evolving partnerships and engagement with internal and external collaborators is likely to improve outcomes. When infrastructure to support communication between officials is paired with active and in-person convening, robust partnerships tend to happen, with more measurable outcomes.\n Capacity to address food access and food insecurity is extended by collaboration, but to collaborate often requires some initial capacity. In the case of many rural places in New York State, there is very little initial capacity, which limits the power of collaboration.",

        "Description": "While forensic science is a well-established discipline, a number of federal agencies have highlighted challenges that continue to plague the field and the extent to which these challenges remain unaddressed. Examples are the illegal trade of wildlife timber and the drug epidemic. Characterization of these materials requires nuanced method development for compound determination, matrix material-specific protocols, and heavy use of expensive consumables. The application of a technique such as direct analysis in real time \u2013 high-resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS) provides the opportunity to circumvent many of the challenges presented by conventional methods. In general, little to no sample preparation is required and a consistent sample analysis approach can be applied to most samples. This work explored the development and application of DART-HRMS through the investigation of the identification of New Psychoactive Substances (NPSs), psychoactive plants, and trade-regulated timber. The procedure for rapid structure determination of NPSs combines neutral loss mass spectral information from DART-HRMS data acquired at multiple voltages under collision-induced dissociation (CID) conditions, thereby resulting in varying levels of molecule fragmentation. This approach falls under the umbrella of \u201cdata fusion\u201d, which is a strategy that combines the output from multiple data sets in order to improve the accuracy of the results. A second focus on psychoactive substances is the development of the Database of Psychoactive Plants (DoPP). This tool is designed to be user-friendly and includes an architecture for identifying plant unknowns. The application is based on the observation that plants display specific chemical signatures that are detectable by DART-HRMS. The subsequent automated machine learning processing of libraries of these spectra enabled the rapid discrimination and identification of species, resulting in a chemical signature database containing 57 available plant species. Another focus of this work is the development of an analysis approach to be used in a wildlife forensics context. Depending on the species, trade in timber can be totally or heavily restricted. A current technique used by law enforcement to differentiate species of wood is DART-HRMS, coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. Although this method is useful in a laboratory setting, it is impractical in field applications (such as for the determination of timber species identity in shipping containers at ports). The added dimension of wood headspace analysis by solid phase microextraction (SPME) was used to generate data to complement that acquired using the conventional wood analysis technique to facilitate the development of \u201cstand-off\u201d approaches for the differentiation of wood species based on their volatiles profiles.",

This is the fifth in a series of Needs Assessments (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022) that have been produced with funding from the NYSB5 grants.\nThe goal of this report is to identify the current (2023) and ongoing support and training needs of the ECCE workforce. The previous Needs Assessments have included the perspectives of providers and parents. This 2023 Needs Assessment is focused on workforce supports and needs from the perspective of Early Childhood Care and Education professionals and students who are planning to enter the workforce, are currently attending post-secondary institutions, and are working towards their Child Development Associate (CDA) certification. It should be noted that while New York State has invested time, money, and resources into addresses the needs of the ECCE workforce over the last several years, this report is focused on identifying new or continuing gaps in addressing these needs.",

        "Description": "In recent years, broad access to digital communication tools provided by the \u201ctech boom\u201d has forced arts and culture nonprofit organizations (ACNPO) to transition to social media and mobile applications to engage audiences. While various approaches focus on building breadth (i.e. recirculation of content) and depth (i.e. replies) of engagement, ACNPO use multimedia to spur discussion and dissemination of their mission. Dependent on individual donors who generally give in small amounts, ACNPO are reliant on effective and visual social media campaigns to drive virality and broaden marketing appeal. Yet questions remain whether the presence of multimedia-inclusive posts (MIP) generates broader and deeper engagement, with conflicting theories pointing to both increased and decreased engagement. This study leverages quantitative approaches and the historical Twitter timelines of the top 20 ANCPOs (based on visitation records) in North America to address three key questions. First, do MIP increase engagement breadth, measured by the number of likes and retweets a single post receives? Second, do MIP increase engagement depth, measured by the number of replies generated? Finally, does the presence of MIP simultaneously influence both breadth and depth of engagement, measured by the number of quote tweets? The proposed research also aims to identify how the use of MIP over time changes as ACNPO use MIP more frequently and MIP become more commonplace in the broader social media ecosystem.\nThe findings of this research will present both practical and academic significance. First, there is no known research examining the usage of MIP by ACNPO to build engagement with audiences on Twitter. Therefore, this dissertation will add to the growing literature around social media engagement in general and the use of social media by ACNPO more specifically. Second, effective social media campaigns allow ACNPO to spread awareness about their services to a global audience without the financial burden of traditional means such as printed products. By highlighting the dynamic relationships between MIP and different types of engagement, the results of this dissertation can also inform new social media engagement strategies by ACNPO to increase breadth and depth of future engagement, and hopefully, generate a larger audience for their services.",

        "Description": "Thirty-five  years ago today (November 2nd), the Internet Worm program was set loose to propagate on the Internet.  Noting that now to the computing public (and cybersecurity professionals, specifically) often generates an \"Oh, really?\" response akin to stating that November 2nd is the anniversary of the inaugural broadcast of the first BBC TV channel (1936), and the launch of Sputnik 2 with Laika aboard (1957).  That is, to many, it is ho-hum, ancient history.\nPerhaps that is to be expected after 35 years -- approximately the length of a human generation. (As an aside, I have been teaching at Purdue for 36 years. I have already taught students whose parents had taken one of my classes as a student; in five or so years, I may see students whose grandparents took one of my classes!). In 1988, fewer than 100,000 machines were likely connected to the Internet; thus, only a few thousand people were involved in systems administration and security. For us, the events were more profound, but we are outnumbered by today's user population; many of us have retired from the field...and more than a few have passed on. Thus, events of decades ago have become ancient history for current users.\nNonetheless, the event and its aftermath were profound for those who lived through it. No major security incident had ever occurred on such a scale before.  The Worm was the top news story in international media for days. The events retold in Cliff Stoll's Cuckoo's Egg were only a few years earlier but had affected far fewer systems. However, that tale of computer espionage heightened concern by authorities in the days following the Worm's deployment regarding its origin and purpose. It seeded significant changes in law enforcement, defense funding and planning, and how we all looked at interconnectivity. In the following years, malware (and especially non-virus malware) became an increasing problem, from Code Red and Nimda to today's botnets and ransomware. All of that eventually led to a boom in add-on security measures, resulting in what is now a multi-billion dollar cybersecurity industry. \nAt the time of the Worm, the study of computing security (the term \"cybersecurity\" had not yet appeared) was primarily based around cryptography, formal verification of program correctness, and limiting covert channels.  The Worm illustrated that there was a larger scope needed, although it took additional events (such as the aforementioned worms and malware) to drive the message home.  Until the late 1990s, many people still believed  cybersecurity was simply a matter of attentive cyber hygiene and not an independent, valid field of study. (I frequently encountered this attitude in academic circles, and was told it was present in the discussion leading to my tenure. That may seem difficult to believe today, but should not be surprising: Purdue has the oldest degree-granting CS department [60 years old this year], and it was initially viewed by some as simply glorified accounting! It is often the case that outsiders dismiss an emerging discipline as trivial or irrelevant.) \nThe Worm provided us with an object lesson about many issues that, unfortunately, were not heeded in full to this day.  That multi-billion dollar cybersecurity industry is still failing to protect far too many of our systems.  Among those lessons:\nInterconnected systems with long-lasting access (e.g., .rshrc files) created a playground for lateral movement across enterprises.  We knew then that good security practice involved fully mediated access (now often referred to as \"Zero Trust\") and had known that for some time.  However, convenience was viewed as more important than security...a problem that continues to vex us to this day.  We continue to build systems that both enable effortless lateral movement, and  make it difficult or annoying for users to reauthenticate, thus leading them to bypass the checks.\nSystems without separation of privilege facilitated the spread of malware.  Current attackers who manage to penetrate key services or privileged accounts are able to gain broader access to entire networks, including the ability to shut off monitoring and updates.  We have proven methods of limiting access (SELinux is one example) but they are too infrequently used. \nSharing information across organizations can result in a more robust, more timely response.  Today, we still have organizations that refuse to disclose if they have been compromised, thus delaying our societal response; information obtained by government agencies has too often been classified, or at least closely held.. The information that is shared is frequently incomplete or not timely. \nThe use of type-unsafe languages with minimal security features can lead to flaws that may be exploited.  One only needs to survey recent CVE entries and attack reports to see buffer overflows, type mismatches, and other well-known software flaws leading to compromise.  Many organizations are still producing or reusing software written in C or C++ that are especially prone to such errors.  Sadly, higher education is complicit by teaching those languages as primary, mainly because their graduates may not be employable without them.\nHeterogenity of systems provides some bulwark against common attacks.  Since 1988, the number of standard operating systems in use has decreased, as has the underlying machine architectures. There are clearly economic arguments for reduced numbers of platforms, but the homogeneity facilitates common attacks. Consideration of when to reuse and when to build new is sadly infrequent.\nThe Worm incident generated conflicting signals about the propriety of hacking into other people's systems and writing malware.  Some people who knew the Worm's author rose to his defense, claiming he was demonstrating security problems and not doing anything wrong. Malware authors and system attackers commonly made that same claim in the decades following, with mixed responses from the community. It still colors the thinking of many in the field, justifying some very dubious behavior as somehow justified by results. Although there is nuance in some discussions, the grey areas around pen testing, companies selling spyware, and \"ethical\" hacking still enable plausible explanations for bad behavior.\nThat last point is  important as we  debate the dangers and adverse side-effects of machine learning/LLM/AI systems.  Those are being refined and deployed by people claiming they are not responsible for the (mis)use of (or errors in) those systems and that their economic potential outweighs any social costs.  We have failed to clearly understand and internalize that not everything that can be done  should be done, especially in the Internet at large.  This is an issue that keeps coming up and we continue to fail to address it properly.\nAs a field, cybersecurity is relatively young.  We have a history that arguably starts in the 1960s with the Ware Report.  We are still discovering what is involved in protecting systems, data privacy, and safety.  Heck, we still need a commonly accepted definition of what cybersecurity entails! (Cf. Chapter 1 of the Cybersecurity Myths book, referenced below.). The first cybersecurity degree program wasn't established until 2000 (at Purdue).  We still lack useful metrics to know whether we are making significant progress and titrate investment. And we are still struggling with tools and techniques to create and maintain secure systems.  All this while the market (and thus need) is expanding globally.\nIn that context of growth and need, we should not dismiss the past as \"Ho-hum, history.\" Members of the military study historic battles to avoid future mistakes: mentioning the Punic Wars or The Battle of Thermopylae to such a scholar will not result in dismissal with \"Not relevant.\"  If you are interested in cybersecurity, it would be advisable to study some history of the field and think about lessons learned -- and unlearned.\nFurther Reading\nThe Ware Report\nThis can be seen as one of the first descriptions of cybersecurity challenges, needs and approaches.\n\nThe protection of information in computer systems\nA paper from 1975 by J.H. Saltzer and M.D. Schroeder.  This paper refers to basic design principles, in large part inspired by Multics, that include complete mediation (now somewhat captured by \"Zero Trust\") and least privilege.  These are most often violated by software rather than designed in, especially economy of mechanism. \n (Versions of this paper may be found outside the paywall via web search engines.)\n\nHistorical papers archive\nA collection of historical papers presenting the early foundation of cybersecurity.  This includes the Ware Report, and its follow-on, the Anderson Report.  Some other, hard-to-find items are here.\n\nThe Communications of the ACM Worm Issue\nAn issue of CACM was devoted to papers about the Worm.\n\nThe Internet Worm: An Analysis\nMy full report analyzing what the Worm program did and how it was structured.\n\nThe Internet Worm Incident\nA report describing the timeline of the Worm release, spread, discovery, and response.\n\nHappy birthday, dear viruses\nThis is a short article in Science I coauthored with Richard Ford for the 25th anniversary of the Worm, about malware generally.\n\nCybersecurity Myths and Misconceptions\nA new book about things the public and even cybersecurity experts mistakenly believe about cybersecurity.  Chapter 1 addresses, in depth, how we do not have an accepted definition of cybersecurity or metrics to measure it.  Other items alluded to in this blog post are also addressed in the book.\n\nCyber security challenges and windmills\nOne of my blog posts, from 2009, about how we continue to generate studies of what would improve cybersecurity and then completely fail to heed them.  The situation has not improved in the years since then.",
