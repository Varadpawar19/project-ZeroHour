    "contentSnippet": "This paper presents a novel approach for mitigating wormhole attacks on wireless networks using propagation delay timing. The wormhole attack is a persistent security threat that threatens the integrity of network communications, potentially leading to data theft or other malicious activities. While various methods exist for combating wormhole attacks, our approach offers advantages that set it apart. Our approach involves a combination of proactive and reactive measures, harnessing box plot analysis and weighting factor techniques to identify and isolate outlier node links effectively. Unlike traditional methods, our solution not only detects outlier links but also defines dynamic weighting factors, providing a more adaptive response to network anomalies. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, testing was conducted using a custom-built testbed running on an external network simulator. The results demonstrate that our proposed technique identifies outlier links, defines appropriate weighting factors, and isolates questionable links. Compared to existing methodologies, our approach exhibits better performance with easier installation and lower overhead while adapting to evolving attack strategies. In conclusion, this paper presents a practical and highly effective solution for mitigating wormhole attacks in wireless networks, distinguishing itself through its adaptability to changing networks while maintaining ease of installation and low overhead."

    "pubDate": "2024-10-07T20:34:00.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "Engagement is a critical part of student learning and student success. This is especially true in online classes where students have less interaction with their classmates and instructors when compared to traditional face-to-face courses. Research on engagement has shown that when students are meaningfully engaged it can increase student satisfaction and it may also increase levels of academic achievement, including grades earned and degree progression (e.g. Wong et al., 2024). This paper focuses on social engagement in a graduate cybersecurity program that uses large, expandable online courses as described by Whitman and Mattord (2023). Large online graduate classes (i.e., more than 35 students in one class) present a new challenge to educators who are traditionally accustomed to teaching graduate classes with much smaller enrollment. To help faculty meaningfully engage students in large online classes, this paper presents three strategies for faculty to synchronously connect with students in an asynchronous class: welcome events, drop-in sessions, and happy hours. Finally, this paper will also report the results from a survey administered to cybersecurity students in a large online class to measure their perceptions of engagement."

    "contentSnippet": "Cybersecurity threats have been a serious and growing problem for decades. In addition, a severe shortage of cybersecurity professionals has been proliferating for nearly as long. These problems exist in the United States and globally and are well documented in literature. This study examined what state universities are doing to help address the shortage of cybersecurity professionals since higher education institutions are a primary source to the workforce pipeline. It is suggested that the number of cybersecurity professionals entering the workforce is related to the number of available programs. Thus increasing the number of programs will increase the number of cybersecurity professionals entering the workforce. This study used a qualitative approach to examine the programs offered through a sample of 201 state universities using a document review of online academic catalogs. The research examined the quantities and levels of cybersecurity programs and identified the institutions that used the National Centers of Academic Excellence (CAE) structure to develop their programs. The results showed that an impressive 84.6% of the universities sampled offered a cybersecurity program and of which more than 50% received a CAE designation. Although the results were impressive, there are still unanswered questions requiring further study in regards to having a satisfactory number of programs to generate the needed talent to reduce the shortage. This study generated several important questions and recommendations and highlighted the availability of cybersecurity programs at the state university level at a snapshot in time. The results can be used to help identify any additional academic needs to help address the shortage of cybersecurity professionals."

The proposed methodology involves collecting propagation delay data in both normal network scenarios and scenarios with inserted malicious wormhole nodes. By comparing these delay timings, our approach aims to differentiate between legitimate network paths and potential wormhole shortcuts. Utilizing the NS-3 network simulator, we validate the effectiveness of our method in accurately detecting and mitigating wormhole attacks. The key advantage of our approach lies in its proactive nature and ability to detect wormholes without relying on specific attack signatures or additional hardware. Using the consistency of propagation delay data, our method offers a promising avenue for early detection and prevention of wormhole attacks, thereby enhancing network security and reliability. The results and insights presented in this paper contribute to the ongoing efforts in developing defense mechanisms against sophisticated network attacks, emphasizing the potential of propagation delay analysis in addressing the challenges posed by wormhole threats in wireless networks."

Many students struggle to focus on schoolwork, due to a lack of interest, lack of understanding, or other factors unique to the student. Applying gamification elements to education can help engage these students in learning their course material and help them excel academically. This study examines the effectiveness of using gamification techniques to enhance the learning experience in college Computer Science courses. A video game application is utilized to review and reinforce cybersecurity concepts that students have already been taught in class. Previous work has been made on a prototype game build that teaches about ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) components. The focus of this study is to refine and develop the structure of the prototype into a more interactive and enjoyable format with non-competitive and captivating activities that allow students to study at their own pace. An updated version of the game was created that focused on reaching a balance between education and entertainment. The game was used by students enrolled in a cybersecurity class, where pre-survey, post-survey and a focus group interview were conducted to determine how effective the updated version is compared to the current build, in addition to how effective the gamification method is regarding student retention of taught material. The pre-survey and post-survey results revealed an increase in interest and mastery of cybersecurity concepts as a result of playing the game. Students found value in the game as both a method of reviewing material taught in class and an entertaining and engaging game. These results show potential in using gamification in cybersecurity and education."

    "contentSnippet": "The cybersecurity threat landscape evolves quickly, continually, and consequentially. This means that the transfer of cybersecurity learning is crucial. We compared how different recognized “cognitive” transfer theories might help explain and synergize three aspects of cybersecurity education. These include teaching and training in diverse settings, assessing learning formatively & summatively, and testing & measuring achievement, proficiency, & readiness. We excluded newer sociocultural theories and their implications for inclusion as we explore those theories elsewhere. We first summarized the history of cybersecurity education and proficiency standards considering transfer theories. We then explored each theory and reviewed the most relevant cybersecurity education research; in some cases, we broadened our search to computing education. We concluded that (a) archaic differential transfer theories are still influential but have negative implications to be avoided, (b) constructionist theories are popular in K-12 settings but raise issues for assessment and transfer, (c) many embrace a general cognitive science perspective that can resolve tensions between modern cognitive-associationist and cognitive-constructivist theories that are popular with innovators, and (d) new perceptual and coordinative theories have potential worth exploring. These insights should support “generative” cybersecurity learning that transfers readily and widely to future classes, tests, and workplaces. These insights should be beneficial when designing and using cyber “ranges” and other hyper-realistic simulations, where transfer assumptions inform costly design decisions and undergird the validity of performance as evidence of proficiency."

    "pubDate": "2023-12-18T18:36:48.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "Data transfer between isolated clusters is imperative for cybersecurity education, research, and testing. Such techniques facilitate hands-on cybersecurity learning in isolated clusters, allow cybersecurity students to practice with various hacking tools, and develop professional cybersecurity technical skills. Educators often use these remote learning environments for research as well. Researchers and students use these isolated environments to test sophisticated hardware, software, and procedures using full-fledged operating systems, networks, and applications. Virus and malware researchers may wish to release suspected malicious software in a controlled environment to observe their behavior better or gain the information needed to assist their reverse engineering processes. The isolation prevents harm to networked systems. However, there are times when the data is required to move in such quantities or speeds that it makes downloading onto an intermediate device untenable. This study proposes a novel turnstile model, a mechanism for one-way file transfer from one enterprise system to another without allowing data leakage. This system protects data integrity and security by connecting the isolated environment to the external network via a locked-down interconnection. Using medium-security isolated clusters, the researchers successfully developed a unidirectional file transfer system that acts as a one-way “turnstile” for secure file transfer between systems not connected to the internet or other external networks. The Turnstile system (source code available at github.com/monnin/turnstile) provides unidirectional file transfer between two computer systems. The solution enabled data to be transferred from a source system to a destination system without allowing any data to be transferred back in the opposite direction. The researchers found an automated process of transferring external files to isolated clusters optimized the transfer speed of external files to isolated clusters using Linux distributions and commands."

An out-of-bounds read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the Contiki-NG operating system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-ber.c module, where the function snmp_ber_decode_string_len_buffer decodes the string length from a received SNMP packet. In one place, one byte is read from the buffer, without checking that the buffer has another byte available, leading to a possible out-of-bounds read. The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG pull request #2936. It will be included in the next release of Contiki-NG. Users are advised to apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. A workaround is to disable the SNMP module in the Contiki-NG build configuration.2024-11-278.3CVE-2024-41125\ncontiki-ng--contiki-ng\n Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read of 1 byte can be triggered when sending a packet to a device running the Contiki-NG operating system with SNMP enabled. The SNMP module is disabled in the default Contiki-NG configuration. The vulnerability exists in the os/net/app-layer/snmp/snmp-message.c module, where the snmp_message_decode function fails to check the boundary of the message buffer when reading a byte from it immediately after decoding an object identifier (OID). The problem has been patched in Contiki-NG pull request 2937. It will be included in the next release of Contiki-NG. Users are advised to either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. A workaround is to disable the SNMP module in the Contiki-NG build configuration.2024-11-278.3CVE-2024-41126\ncontiki-ng--contiki-ng\n Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT devices. An unaligned memory access can be triggered in the two RPL implementations of the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem can occur when either one of these RPL implementations is enabled and connected to an RPL instance. If an IPv6 packet containing an odd number of padded bytes before the RPL option, it can cause the rpl_ext_header_hbh_update function to read a 16-bit integer from an odd address. The impact of this unaligned read is architecture-dependent, but can potentially cause the system to crash. The problem has not been patched as of release 4.9, but will be included in the next release. One can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2962 to patch the system or wait for the next release.2024-11-277.5CVE-2024-47181\nCool Plugins--Cryptocurrency Widgets For Elementor\n Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion') vulnerability in Cool Plugins Cryptocurrency Widgets For Elementor allows PHP Local File Inclusion.This issue affects Cryptocurrency Widgets For Elementor: from n/a through 1.6.4.2024-11-308.1CVE-2024-53739\nCradlepoint--NetCloud Exchange Client\n The NetCloud Exchange client for Windows, version 1.110.50, contains an insecure file and folder permissions vulnerability.

In affected versions acks are not validated before being written to the qlog leading to a buffer overflow. In `ngtcp2_conn::conn_recv_pkt` for an ACK, there was new logic that got added to skip `conn_recv_ack` if an ack has already been processed in the payload. However, this causes us to also skip `ngtcp2_pkt_validate_ack`. The ack which was skipped still got written to qlog. The bug occurs in `ngtcp2_qlog::write_ack_frame`. It is now possible to reach this code with an invalid ack, suppose `largest_ack=0` and `first_ack_range=15`. Subtracting `largest_ack - first_ack_range` will lead to an integer underflow which is 20 chars long. However, the ngtcp2 qlog code assumes the number written is a signed integer and only accounts for 19 characters of overhead (see `NGTCP2_QLOG_ACK_FRAME_RANGE_OVERHEAD`). Therefore, we overwrite the buffer causing a heap overflow. This is high priority and could potentially impact many users if they enable qlog. qlog is disabled by default. Due to its overhead, it is most likely used for debugging purpose, but the actual use is unknown. ngtcp2 v1.9.1 fixes the bug and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not turn on qlog.2024-11-258.2CVE-2024-52811\nninjateam--File Manager Pro Filester\n The File Manager Pro - Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing validation in the 'fsConnector' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.4.

The default cache strategy uses the basename of a remote schema as the name of the file in the cache, e.g. `https://example.org/schema.json` will be stored as `schema.json`. This naming allows for conflicts. If an attacker can get a user to run `check-jsonschema` against a malicious schema URL, e.g., `https://example.evil.org/schema.json`, they can insert their own schema into the cache and it will be picked up and used instead of the appropriate schema. Such a cache confusion attack could be used to allow data to pass validation which should have been rejected. This issue has been patched in version 0.30.0. All users are advised to upgrade. A few workarounds exist: 1. Users can use `--no-cache` to disable caching. 2. Users can use `--cache-filename` to select filenames for use in the cache, or to ensure that other usages do not overwrite the cached schema. (Note: this flag is being deprecated as part of the remediation effort.) 3. Users can explicitly download the schema before use as a local file, as in `curl -LOs https://example.org/schema.json; check-jsonschema --schemafile ./schema.json`2024-11-297.1CVE-2024-53848\nQualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon\n On some hardware revisions where VP9 decoding is hardware-accelerated, the frame size is not programmed correctly into the decoder hardware which can lead to an invalid memory access by the decoder.2024-11-269.8CVE-2017-11076\nQualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon\n In multiple functions that process 802.11 frames, out-of-bounds reads can occur due to insufficient validation.2024-11-269.8CVE-2017-17772\nQualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon\n Wrong configuration in Touch Pal application can collect user behavior data without awareness by the user.2024-11-269.8CVE-2018-11922\nQualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon\n Initial xbl_sec revision does not have all the debug policy features and critical checks.2024-11-268.4CVE-2016-10394\nQualcomm, Inc.--Snapdragon\n QSEE will randomly experience a fatal error during execution due to speculative instruction fetches from device memory.

An authenticated user (**UserA**) with no privileges is authorized to read all files created in sandbox belonging to other users in the sandbox folders `C:\\Sandbox\\UserB\\xxx`. An authenticated attacker who can use `explorer.exe` or `cmd.exe` outside any sandbox can read other users' files in `C:\\Sandbox\\xxx`. By default in Windows 7+, the `C:\\Users\\UserA` folder is not readable by **UserB**. All files edited or created during the sandbox processing are affected by the vulnerability. All files in C:\\Users are safe. If `UserB` runs a cmd in a sandbox, he will be able to access `C:\\Sandox\\UserA`. In addition, if **UserB** create a folder `C:\\Sandbox\\UserA` with malicious ACLs, when **UserA** will user the sandbox, Sandboxie doesn't reset ACLs ! This issue has not yet been fixed.

A security vulnerability has been identified in the GitHub CLI that could leak authentication tokens when cloning repositories containing `git` submodules hosted outside of GitHub.com and ghe.com. This vulnerability stems from several `gh` commands used to clone a repository with submodules from a non-GitHub host including `gh repo clone`, `gh repo fork`, and `gh pr checkout`. These GitHub CLI commands invoke git with instructions to retrieve authentication tokens using the `credential.helper` configuration variable for any host encountered. Prior to version `2.63.0`, hosts other than GitHub.com and ghe.com are treated as GitHub Enterprise Server hosts and have tokens sourced from the following environment variables before falling back to host-specific tokens stored within system-specific secured storage: 1. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, 2. `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` and 3. `GITHUB_TOKEN` when the `CODESPACES` environment variable is set. The result being `git` sending authentication tokens when cloning submodules. In version `2.63.0`, these GitHub CLI commands will limit the hosts for which `gh` acts as a credential helper to source authentication tokens. Additionally, `GITHUB_TOKEN` will only be used for GitHub.com and ghe.com. Users are advised to upgrade. Additionally users are advised to revoke authentication tokens used with the GitHub CLI and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise2024-11-276.5CVE-2024-53858\ncli--go-gh\n go-gh is a Go module for interacting with the `gh` utility and the GitHub API from the command line. A security vulnerability has been identified in `go-gh` that could leak authentication tokens intended for GitHub hosts to non-GitHub hosts when within a codespace. `go-gh` sources authentication tokens from different environment variables depending on the host involved: 1. `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` for GitHub.com and ghe.com and 2. `GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN`, `GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN` for GitHub Enterprise Server. Prior to version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` could source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for a host other than GitHub.com or ghe.com when within a codespace. In version `2.11.1`, `auth.TokenForHost` will only source a token from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for GitHub.com or ghe.com hosts. Successful exploitation could send authentication token to an unintended host. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users are also advised to regenerate authentication tokens and to review their personal security log and any relevant audit logs for actions associated with their account or enterprise.2024-11-276.5CVE-2024-53859\ncode-projects--Farmacia\n A vulnerability was found in code-projects Farmacia up to 1.0.

This issue occurs because sensitive runtime values, such as passwords, may be captured during the Keycloak build process and embedded as default values in bytecode, leading to unintended information disclosure. In Keycloak 26, sensitive data specified directly in environment variables during the build process is also stored as a default values, making it accessible during runtime. Indirect usage of environment variables for SPI options and Quarkus properties is also vulnerable due to unconditional expansion by PropertyMapper logic, capturing sensitive data as default values in all Keycloak versions up to 26.0.2.2024-11-255.9CVE-2024-10451\nRed Hat--Red Hat build of Keycloak 24\n A vulnerability was found in the Keycloak Server. The Keycloak Server is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to improper handling of proxy headers. When Keycloak is configured to accept incoming proxy headers, it may accept non-IP values, such as obfuscated identifiers, without proper validation. This issue can lead to costly DNS resolution operations, which an attacker could exploit to tie up IO threads and potentially cause a denial of service. The attacker must have access to send requests to a Keycloak instance that is configured to accept proxy headers, specifically when reverse proxies do not overwrite incoming headers, and Keycloak is configured to trust these headers.2024-11-254.7CVE-2024-9666\nRed Hat--Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extended Lifecycle Support\n A log spoofing flaw was found in the Tuned package due to improper sanitization of some API arguments. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a controlled sequence of characters; newlines can be inserted into the log. Instead of the 'evil' the attacker could mimic a valid TuneD log line and trick the administrator. The quotes '' are usually used in TuneD logs citing raw user input, so there will always be the ' character ending the spoofed input, and the administrator can easily overlook this. This logged string is later used in logging and in the output of utilities, for example, `tuned-adm get_instances` or other third-party programs that use Tuned's D-Bus interface for such operations.2024-11-265.5CVE-2024-52337\nRed Hat--Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4\n A flaw was found in OpenShift Console. A Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack can happen if an attacker supplies all or part of a URL to the server to query. The server is considered to be in a privileged network position and can often reach exposed services that aren't readily available to clients due to network filtering. Leveraging such an attack vector, the attacker can have an impact on other services and potentially disclose information or have other nefarious effects on the system. The /api/dev-console/proxy/internet endpoint on the OpenShit Console allows authenticated users to have the console's pod perform arbitrary and fully controlled HTTP(s) requests. The full response to these requests is returned by the endpoint. While the name of this endpoint suggests the requests are only bound to the internet, no such checks are in place. An authenticated user can therefore ask the console to perform arbitrary HTTP requests from outside the cluster to a service inside the cluster.2024-11-255.3CVE-2024-6538\nRejuan Ahamed--Best Addons for Elementor\n Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in Rejuan Ahamed Best Addons for Elementor allows Stored XSS.This issue affects Best Addons for Elementor: from n/a through 1.0.5.2024-11-306.5CVE-2024-53763\nrswebstudios--Image Alt Text\n The Image Alt Text plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data| due to a missing capability check on the iat_add_alt_txt_action and iat_update_alt_txt_action AJAX actions in all versions up to, and including, 2.0.0.

This bug impacts clients using any variation of KeylessVerifier.verify(). The verifier may accept a bundle with an unrelated log entry, cryptographically verifying everything but fails to ensure the log entry applies to the artifact in question, thereby \"verifying\" a bundle without any proof the signing event was logged. This allows the creation of a bundle without fulcio certificate and private key combined with an unrelated but time-correct log entry to fake logging of a signing event. A malicious actor using a compromised identity may want to do this to prevent discovery via rekor's log monitors. The signer's identity will still be available to the verifier. The signature on the bundle must still be on the correct artifact for the verifier to pass. sigstore-gradle-plugin and sigstore-maven-plugin are not affected by this as they only provide signing functionality.

The Contiki-NG operating system processes source routing headers (SRH) in its two alternative RPL protocol implementations. The IPv6 implementation uses the results of this processing to determine whether an incoming packet should be forwarded to another host. Because of missing validation of the resulting next-hop address, an uncontrolled recursion may occur in the tcpip_ipv6_output function in the os/net/ipv6/tcpip.c module when receiving a packet with a next-hop address that is a local address. Attackers that have the possibility to send IPv6 packets to the Contiki-NG host can therefore trigger deeply nested recursive calls, which can cause a stack overflow. The vulnerability has not been patched in the current release of Contiki-NG, but is expected to be patched in the next release. The problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2264. Users are advised to either apply the patch manually or to wait for the next release. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.2024-11-27not yet calculatedCVE-2023-29001\nDevolutions--XTS.NET\n Non constant time cryptographic operation in Devolutions.XTS.NET 2024.11.19 and earlier allows an attacker to render half of the encryption key obsolete via a timing attacks2024-11-27not yet calculatedCVE-2024-11862\ndrakkan--sftpgo\n sftpgo is a full-featured and highly configurable event-driven file transfer solution.

This issue has been addressed in release version 0.12.7. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.2024-11-27not yet calculatedCVE-2024-53849\nethyca--fides\n Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform. The user invite acceptance API endpoint lacks server-side password policy enforcement, allowing users to set arbitrarily weak passwords by bypassing client-side validation. While the UI enforces password complexity requirements, direct API calls can circumvent these checks, enabling the creation of accounts with passwords as short as a single character. When an email messaging provider is enabled and a new user account is created in the system, an invite email containing a special link is sent to the new user's email address. This link directs the new user to a page where they can set their initial password. While the user interface implements password complexity checks, these validations are only performed client-side. The underlying `/api/v1/user/accept-invite` API endpoint does not implement the same password policy validations. This vulnerability allows an invited user to set an extremely weak password for their own account during the initial account setup process. Therefore that specific user's account can be compromised easily by an attacker guessing or brute forcing the password. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.50.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.

An incorrect string comparison is run for `iss` checking, resulting in `\"acb\"` being accepted for `\"_abc_\"`. This is a bug introduced in version 2.10.0: checking the \"iss\" claim changed from `isinstance(issuer, list)` to `isinstance(issuer, Sequence)`. Since str is a Sequnce, but not a list, `in` is also used for string comparison. This results in `if \"abc\" not in \"__abcd__\":` being checked instead of `if \"abc\" != \"__abc__\":`. Signature checks are still present so real world impact is likely limited to denial of service scenarios. This issue has been patched in version 2.10.1. All users are advised to upgrade.

The JPEG decoder used by the JPEG XL encoder when doing JPEG recompression (i.e. if using JxlEncoderAddJPEGFrame on untrusted input) does not properly check bounds in the presence of incomplete codes. This could lead to an out-of-bounds write. In jpegli which is released as part of the same project, the same vulnerability is present. However, the relevant buffer is part of a bigger structure, and the code makes no assumptions on the values that could be overwritten.

A large amount of the complexity arises from trying to handle errors late in the process of mapping a VMA, which forms the basis of recently observed issues with resource leaks and observable inconsistent state. Taking advantage of previous patches in this series we move a number of checks earlier in the code, simplifying things by moving the core of the logic into a static internal function __mmap_region(). Doing this allows us to perform a number of checks up front before we do any real work, and allows us to unwind the writable unmap check unconditionally as required and to perform a CONFIG_DEBUG_VM_MAPLE_TREE validation unconditionally also. We move a number of things here: 1. We preallocate memory for the iterator before we call the file-backed memory hook, allowing us to exit early and avoid having to perform complicated and error-prone close/free logic. We carefully free iterator state on both success and error paths. 2. The enclosing mmap_region() function handles the mapping_map_writable() logic early. Previously the logic had the mapping_map_writable() at the point of mapping a newly allocated file-backed VMA, and a matching mapping_unmap_writable() on success and error paths. We now do this unconditionally if this is a file-backed, shared writable mapping. If a driver changes the flags to eliminate VM_MAYWRITE, however doing so does not invalidate the seal check we just performed, and we in any case always decrement the counter in the wrapper. We perform a debug assert to ensure a driver does not attempt to do the opposite. 3. We also move arch_validate_flags() up into the mmap_region() function. This is only relevant on arm64 and sparc64, and the check is only meaningful for SPARC with ADI enabled. We explicitly add a warning for this arch if a driver invalidates this check, though the code ought eventually to be fixed to eliminate the need for this. With all of these measures in place, we no longer need to explicitly close the VMA on error paths, as we place all checks which might fail prior to a call to any driver mmap hook. This eliminates an entire class of errors, makes the code easier to reason about and more robust.2024-11-25not yet calculatedCVE-2024-53096\nLinux--Linux\n In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm: krealloc: Fix MTE false alarm in __do_krealloc This patch addresses an issue introduced by commit 1a83a716ec233 (\"mm: krealloc: consider spare memory for __GFP_ZERO\") which causes MTE (Memory Tagging Extension) to falsely report a slab-out-of-bounds error.

This may lead to a race between the fabric controller admin queue destroy code path (invoked while shutting down controller) and hw/hctx queue dispatcher called from the nvme keep-alive async request queuing operation. This race could lead to the kernel crash shown below: Call Trace: autoremove_wake_function+0x0/0xbc (unreliable) __blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x114/0x24c blk_mq_sched_dispatch_requests+0x44/0x84 blk_mq_run_hw_queue+0x140/0x220 nvme_keep_alive_work+0xc8/0x19c [nvme_core] process_one_work+0x200/0x4e0 worker_thread+0x340/0x504 kthread+0x138/0x140 start_kernel_thread+0x14/0x18 While shutting down fabric controller, if nvme keep-alive request sneaks in then it would be flushed off. The nvme_keep_alive_end_io function is then invoked to handle the end of the keep-alive operation which decrements the admin->q_usage_counter and assuming this is the last/only request in the admin queue then the admin->q_usage_counter becomes zero. If that happens then blk-mq destroy queue operation (blk_mq_destroy_ queue()) which could be potentially running simultaneously on another cpu (as this is the controller shutdown code path) would forward progress and deletes the admin queue. So, now from this point onward we are not supposed to access the admin queue resources. However the issue here's that the nvme keep-alive thread running hw/hctx queue dispatch operation hasn't yet finished its work and so it could still potentially access the admin queue resource while the admin queue had been already deleted and that causes the above crash. This fix helps avoid the observed crash by implementing keep-alive as a synchronous operation so that we decrement admin->q_usage_counter only after keep-alive command finished its execution and returns the command status back up to its caller (blk_execute_rq()). This would ensure that fabric shutdown code path doesn't destroy the fabric admin queue until keep-alive request finished execution and also keep-alive thread is not running hw/hctx queue dispatch operation.2024-11-25not yet calculatedCVE-2024-53102\nMozilla--Firefox\n The application failed to account for exceptions thrown by the `loadManifestFromFile` method during add-on signature verification.

A malicious actor can send a IEEE 802.15.4 packet with spoofed length byte and optionally spoofed FCS, which eventually results into an endless loop on a CC2538 as receiver. Before PR #20998, the receiver would check for the location of the CRC bit using the packet length byte by considering all 8 bits, instead of discarding bit 7, which is what the radio does. This then results into reading outside of the RX FIFO. Although it prints an error when attempting to read outside of the RX FIFO, it will continue doing this. This may lead to a discrepancy in the CRC check according to the firmware and the radio. If the CPU judges the CRC as correct and the radio is set to `AUTO_ACK`, when the packet requests and acknowledgment the CPU will go into the state `CC2538_STATE_TX_ACK`. However, if the radio judged the CRC as incorrect, it will not send an acknowledgment, and thus the `TXACKDONE` event will not fire. It will then never return to the state `CC2538_STATE_READY` since the baseband processing is still disabled. Then the CPU will be in an endless loop. Since setting to idle is not forced, it won't do it if the radio's state is not `CC2538_STATE_READY`. A fix has not yet been made.2024-11-29not yet calculatedCVE-2024-53980\nsveltejs--kit\n SvelteKit is a framework for rapidly developing robust, performant web applications using Svelte. \"Unsanitized input from *the request URL* flows into `end`, where it is used to render an HTML page returned to the user.

There is little to no expected impact. The Vite development is not exposed to the network by default and even if someone were able to trick a developer into executing an XSS against themselves, a development database should not have any sensitive data.

It can contain the following placeholders: %sveltekit.status% - the HTTP status, and %sveltekit.error.message% - the error message. This leads to possible injection if an app explicitly creates an error with a message that contains user controlled content. Only applications where user provided input is used in the `Error` message will be vulnerable, so the vast majority of applications will not be vulnerable This issue has been addressed in version 2.8.3 and all users are advised to upgrade.

    "contentSnippet": "This study, based on Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Lent et al., 1994, 2000), investigated the role of familial support in the STEM career development of Asian American college students. Participants included 446 first-year undergraduate students who identified as Asian or Asian American and had not declared an academic major. Due to multicollinearity, four initial familial support variables—instrumental assistance, career-related modeling, verbal encouragement, and emotional support—were regrouped into two: performance motivation (instrumental assistance and verbal encouragement) and career mentoring (career-related modeling and emotional support). Structural equation modeling showed acceptable fit for a modified model, and the results partially supported the hypothesized paths. Findings indicated that career mentoring, but not performance motivation, was directly and positively associated with STEM coping self-efficacy. No direct relation was found between the support variables and STEM outcome expectations, but career mentoring indirectly influenced outcome expectations through enhanced coping self-efficacy. Neither STEM coping self-efficacy nor outcome expectations had significant direct relations with STEM interest. Performance motivation, but not STEM interest, was directly related to STEM goals. Participants’ generation status was controlled for in all structural analyses. Gender could not be tested as a moderator due to anomalies in the gender analyses, which prevented a credible interpretation of findings related to gender differences. Due to the unique characteristics of the present sample recruited for this study, caution was implicated in interpreting the results and recommending future research. Despite the limitations, the results provided some suggestions about how mental health professionals and educators might develop more effective interventions to support Asian and Asian American students in their pursuit of STEM careers."

Immigrants may be exposed to stressors related to immigration and acculturation. Some research suggests that females respond more to stress through internalizing symptoms relative to males (Hall-Lande et al., 2007; Adkins et al., 2009). Given these gender differences in stress response, female immigrants may be particularly vulnerable to the psychological consequences of immigration related stressors. The immigrant health paradox has also overlooked subjective measures of body weight such as body image which may provide insight into how immigrants adjust to a new context. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, this study explores whether overestimating weight and depressive symptoms differ by nativity status among Asian and Hispanic female adolescents. The findings show no evidence that Asian and Hispanic female’s depressive symptoms differ by nativity status nor was there any evidence that overestimating weight differs by nativity status among these subgroups. In sum, this study provides an estimate of how ethnicity and nativity status affect body image and depressive symptoms across U.S. adolescent females. The findings contribute to our understanding of the immigrant health paradox and suggest that it is not applicable to all health outcomes."

Preferred host species in New York state include agricultural vegetation such as grape vines and fruit trees. Positive Spotted Lanternfly site data collected by the New York Department of Agriculture and Markets and iMapInvasives were analyzed using ArcGIS Pro to assess spatial distribution patterns. Spotted Lanternfly egg masses can be unknowingly spread via transportation pathways such as highways and railroads. Using a multi-scale geographically weighted regression, proximity to these pathways and tree of heaven presence were shown to be significant factors in the location of spotted lanternfly sightings in New York state. Additionally, infestation risk was geographically categorized based on proximity to these transportation pathways and agricultural regions."

As this condition is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder, with a strong evidence base supporting early identification, intervention and parenting practices to promote social communication development, a large portion of the research has focused on identifying characteristics of parent-child interactions amongst this population and determining how best to intervene on the family level to promote the development of these skills (Ku et al., 2019). There have been a variety of tools developed to achieve this goal, but there is a strong need for an observational behavioral coding system that has been standardized across neurotypical and autistic populations, as this would best facilitate comparisons of parent-child interactions across these populations. The current study sought to investigate a tool with that potential. Specifically, this exploratory study sought to identify the parent and child characteristics that are related to behaviors coded for using the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System, Fourth Edition (Eyberg et al., 2013). Additionally, this study sought to identify whether there were differences between in-person and virtual observations of the parent-child interactions. Results indicated that no differences were observed between the virtual and in-person observations of the parent-child interactions in the study. There were several parent and child characteristics that were correlated with specific parent and child interactive behaviors. Strengths and limitations of the study, as well as its implications for future research, are discussed."

    "pubDate": "2024-10-24T22:45:25.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "Quinary interactions arise due to the extreme macromolecular crowding inside live cells. Quinary interactions affect intracellular protein stability, activity, and homeostasis. Ribosomes, traditionally known for their role in protein synthesis, have been found to engage in quinary interactions with metabolic enzymes, modulating their activity and thereby revealing a potential regulatory role for ribosomes in cellular metabolism. This phenomenon, termed the Ribosome-Amplified MetaBOlism (RAMBO) effect, was investigated in this dissertation through a series of in vitro and in vivo studies using primarily Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\nFirstly, an NMR-based direct enzyme assay compatible with ribosome was developed and validated using pyruvate kinase (PYK) from Bacillus stearothermophilus as a probe. A high-quality Escherichia coli 70S ribosomes preparation was developed. Highly purified ribosomes were used to ensure that the observed amplification in enzyme activity was solely attributable to ribosomal interactions. Ribosomes were shown to significantly enhance the PYK activity and chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) was used to identify key ribosomal binding sites of PYK, supporting the RAMBO effect.\nNext, a general mechanism for the RAMBO effect was proposed and elucidated, where the ribosome external electric field (EEF)-substrate dipole interaction energy stabilizes transition states, significantly increasing the activity of triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) from Gallus gallus. NMR spectroscopy was performed to examine the quinary interaction surface of TPI binding to the ribosomes, and to access the TPI kinetic assay. XL-MS coupled with molecular docking were used to determine the potential TPI-ribosome binding conformations, providing structural models for the electric fields and substrate dipoles calculations. Ribosomal protein L11 was identified as the primary binding partner of TPI, confirming the origin of the RAMBO effect.\nFinally, the in vivo RAMBO effect was studied in the context of glycolysis in E. coli using real-time pulse chase (RTPC)-NMR. The activity of pyruvate kinase I (PYFK) from E. coli was significantly enhanced in the presence of ribosomes, but this ribosome-mediated amplification was disrupted by the addition of ribosomal antibiotics in vitro. Kinetic flux profiling (KFP) further demonstrated the RAMBO effect observed in vitro also occurs in live cells, thereby confirming the role of ribosomes metabolic regulation and validating the RAMBO hypothesis."

This dissertation explores the application of Raman spectroscopy combined with machine learning for three critical areas: evaluating perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure in wildlife, authenticating tuna species in the seafood industry, identifying body fluids at crime scenes, and medical diagnostics.\nFirst, Raman spectroscopy and support vector machine discriminant analysis (SVMDA) were employed to detect PFAS levels in the blood plasma of smallmouth bass from two different tributaries, rivers, or streams that flow into larger bodies of water. The method achieved 100% accuracy in differentiating between samples containing either low or high PFAS concentrations, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic tool for fish health.\nSecond, the capability of Raman spectroscopy to authenticate three commonly sold tuna species—yellowfin, bluefin, and escolar was assessed. The developed method accurately identified the species using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), demonstrating its value as a quality control tool in the seafood industry to prevent fraudulent labeling.\nThird, Raman spectroscopy combined with Random Forest machine learning was utilized to identify six main body fluids and distinguish them from 49 potential environmental interferences that may be discovered at crime scenes. The method achieved 100% accuracy in external validation, indicating its effectiveness as a rapid, non-destructive technique for body fluid detection, which is crucial for criminal investigations.\nLastly, the detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was explored using a novel screening method combining Raman spectroscopy with deep learning, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), to analyze blood plasma. The ANN model demonstrated high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in distinguishing between moderate AD patients and healthy controls. This integrative approach offers a promising, non-invasive, rapid, and accurate screening method for early AD detection, potentially enhancing diagnostic capabilities and paving the way for earlier and more effective therapeutic interventions.\nOverall, this research showcases the versatility and efficacy of Raman spectroscopy and machine learning in providing reliable, accurate, and rapid analysis across different fields. Thus offering significant advancements in environmental monitoring, food authentication, and forensic science."

Utilizing precursors for the synthesis of Li- and Na-ion cathode materials are known to ensure a phase-pure product with isotropic element distribution, thereby further enhancing the electrochemical properties of the cathode material. As more cathode materials with complex compositions continue to emerge, the strategies for designing the corresponding precursors are also getting diversified. One of the most promising directions is the employment of single-source precursors (SSPs), defined as molecules that contain all necessary elements in the proper ratio and decomposable under mild conditions to yield phase-pure target compounds upon the low-temperature decomposition. This method both optimizes the synthetic pathways to existing materials and provides an access to new materials that are not accessible by conventional techniques.\nIn this dissertation, the advancement of multiple SSPs through appropriate methods with delicate design steps is described. In general, this work contributes to developing new preparation techniques for prospective Li- and Na-ion metal oxides for rechargeable batteries, as well as to applying the SSP approach to synthesize and characterize unknown materials. At the same time, this thesis provides a detailed analysis of the structure and properties of different SSPs and highlights some unusual cases of isomerism. The isomerization phenomenon not only alter the precursor design approach but also affects the thermal decomposition properties related to the synthesis of target materials."

SASP can lead to cell damage and has been linked to age-related conditions such as cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and osteoarthritis. The epitranscriptome regulates translation through post-transcriptional RNA modifications and can control when and how much of protein synthesis occurs. Several tRNA modifications that include 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5U), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U), and mcm5Um (5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2′-O-methyluridine) are linked to the translation of enzymes involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and defects in these tRNA modifications have been shown to promote senescence. We examined the reprogramming of tRNA modifications in response to pharmaceuticals that limit senescence or SASP in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and human lung fibroblast (IMR-90) cells. These cells were treated with senolytics (Navitoclax and Quercetin) and senomorphs (Metformin and Taurine). Small RNA was purified to analyze tRNA modifications by LC-MS/MS. We have demonstrated that senolytics and senomorphs can re-program tRNA modifications in wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts, specifically 5-methylthio-2-methyluracil (s2mo5U), 7-methylguanosine (m7G), 5-methylcytosine-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U), 2’-O-methylguanosine (Gm), N1-Methyladenosine (m1A), and 5-methoxyuridine (mo5U). We have also demonstrated that senolytics and senomorphs can re-program tRNA modifications in senescent human lung fibroblasts, specifically 7-methylguanosine (m7G), 1-methylguanosine (m1G), N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m22G), 2-methylguanosine (m2G), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), N6-methyladenosine (m6Am), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5U), 2-thiocytidine (s2C), and pseudouridine (Ψ), with our studies being some of the first to explore this hypothesis. Our studies highlight the potential of using senolytic and senomorphic therapeutic agents to treat tRNA-related diseases."

    "contentSnippet": "Video self-modeling (VSM) is an intervention based on Bandura’s (1999) theory of observational learning, which assumes that children learn a target behavior by observing a more competent model. VSM is assumed to provide an effective model from which children can learn given that the learner and model are the same person but differ only in their skills. More recently, studies have explored the effectiveness of VSM as an intervention for oral reading fluency (ORF) and showed promising results. Goal setting (GS) is another intervention that has been found to be effective in increasing students’ performance by motivating them to meet their goal and self-monitor their progress.\nThe current study aimed to expand the existing reading intervention literature by evaluating the effectiveness of VSM as a standalone intervention as well as the additive effect of integrating GS with VSM on ORF. The hypotheses were that VSM alone would be effective in increasing students’ ORF and that adding GS to VSM would further enhance the effectiveness of VSM. The participants were four general education students in third grade who were identified as needing additional reading support due to performing below grade level expectations based on their school’s multi-tier systems of support (MTSS) universal reading assessment. All students were concurrently receiving small group reading interventions from their school.\nA multiple-baseline design across participants was used with each participant being exposed to four phases in the following order: 1) baseline, 2) VSM, 3) VSM with GS, and 4) maintenance. To analyze the results, a combination of visual analysis, in accordance with the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC; Kratochwill et al., 2010) standards, and hierarchical linear modeling, was utilized.\nConsistent with previous studies, the results showed that VSM alone was associated with an increase in words correct per minute (WCPM) where the four participants averaged an increase of 8.5 WCPM (RangeΔ = 2.00 - 14.20) compared to baseline. Additionally, the additive effect of GS when combined with VSM produced an additional average increase of 10.37 WCPM (RangeΔ= 2.63 – 18.67) across participants. Despite this increase in average ORF performance, the results of the visual analysis revealed inconsistent immediate effects and trends, as well as high variability and overlap across phases and participants. Therefore, the interventions did not demonstrate sufficient intervention effects to support their effectiveness based on the WWC criteria. The results from the HLM analysis supported the visual analysis as they revealed treatment effects that lacked statistical significance. A discussion of the interpretation, implications, and limitations of the results as well as future directions is provided."

Thus, the present study aimed to elucidate factors (e.g., mode of instruction, meditation experience, psychological [in]flexibility [PF/PI]) that may relate to intentions guiding meditation use. Methods: Self-taught (ST) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) meditators (N = 122, Mage = 46.54, SDage = 16.49, 65.6% Female) completed a battery of measures assessing meditation intentions (control- or acceptance-based), meditation experience (in months), PF/PI, psychological distress, and satisfaction with life. Results: Control-based intentions covaried with worse psychological outcomes while acceptance-based intentions covaried with better outcomes. Meditation intentions and outcomes did not discriminate between ST and MBSR groups. Yet, satisfaction with life was significantly greater in the MBSR group relative to the ST group. PF fully mediated relations between meditation experience and acceptance-based intentions, whereas PI fully mediated relations between meditation experience and control-based intentions. Conclusion: Meditation experience, rather than mode of instruction, appears to influence whether meditation is used in an acceptance- or control-based context. Mediational findings suggest that such relations work through PF/PI processes. Longitudinal research is needed to evaluate whether meditation intentions change over time and the extent to which such changes influence the acceptability and utility of meditation itself."

Metastasis occurs when cancer cells undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), migrate to distant body tissues, then form new tumors. It is imperative to better understand the process of EMT to develop superior ways to detect breast cancer before becoming metastatic. Recently, post-transcriptional modifications have been implicated in the regulation of EMT in different cancer types. Previous studies lead us to believe that N4-actylcytidine may be involved in the process of EMT in human breast cancer. N4-actylcytidine (ac4C) is produced by the enzyme N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10). To establish an understanding of ac4C’s role, we conducted several experiments while altering the expression of NAT10 in Human Mammary Epithelial (HMLE) cells. In this study, we show that the overexpression of NAT10 in HMLE cells induces certain characteristics of the mesenchymal phenotype. We also confirm a proposed method of ac4C-seq by confirming one N4-acetylcytidine site (C-1842) on the 18S ribosome of HMLE cells. These results help us to better understand the role of ac4C in the process of EMT in human breast cancer which may help to pave the way for better preventative interventions and treatments for patients with metastatic breast cancer."

To estimate the impact of communicating to the public that men who have sex with men (MSM) are most at risk for mpox on potential stigmatization and risk perception.\nMethods. We conducted a survey experiment randomizing exposure to messages about mpox among a sample of the South Korean public (n51500) in July 2022. We randomized respondents to receive an informational message about mpox that was (1) a neutral informational message about mpox that did not highlight its origins or risk groups (control group), (2) a message explaining that the virus originated in Africa, or (3) a message emphasizing that MSM are most at risk.\nResults. We found that emphasizing that MSM are most at risk increases support for policies that would restrict lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender/-sexual, queer or questioning–related events by about 7 percentage points compared with the control condition. However, the message describing African origins did not affect support for restricting travel from Africa. Neither changed risk perceptions or willingness to be vaccinated against mpox.\nConclusions. Messages aimed at educating the public about most at-risk groups may trigger increased stigmatization of those groups in ways that could contribute to unnecessary persecution."

The project used three different data collection methods, interviews, a survey and spatial analysis. This document reports on the interview component of the project.\nThese are the main highlights from the interviews.  \n Interviews were conducted primarily between February 2022 and July 2023, and included 38 full length conversations with town supervisors and village mayors.\n Access to local food varies, but food insecurity is generally considered to be an insignificant problem for most localities.\n Local food production in New York State continues to decline. There are fewer small farms, and many town officials consider the loss of small farms an issue of concern.\n Local food systems projects are rarely prioritized. However, as many food systems projects, such as pantries, community gardens and farmers markets are either low cost or have wider community benefits, they have proliferated. And these activities are often highlighted as important opportunities to build social capital.\n Collaboration matters. Having the structural mechanisms to support robust and evolving partnerships and engagement with internal and external collaborators is likely to improve outcomes. When infrastructure to support communication between officials is paired with active and in-person convening, robust partnerships tend to happen, with more measurable outcomes.\n Capacity to address food access and food insecurity is extended by collaboration, but to collaborate often requires some initial capacity. In the case of many rural places in New York State, there is very little initial capacity, which limits the power of collaboration."

    "pubDate": "2024-09-25T20:20:28.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "While forensic science is a well-established discipline, a number of federal agencies have highlighted challenges that continue to plague the field and the extent to which these challenges remain unaddressed. Examples are the illegal trade of wildlife timber and the drug epidemic. Characterization of these materials requires nuanced method development for compound determination, matrix material-specific protocols, and heavy use of expensive consumables. The application of a technique such as direct analysis in real time – high-resolution mass spectrometry (DART-HRMS) provides the opportunity to circumvent many of the challenges presented by conventional methods. In general, little to no sample preparation is required and a consistent sample analysis approach can be applied to most samples. This work explored the development and application of DART-HRMS through the investigation of the identification of New Psychoactive Substances (NPSs), psychoactive plants, and trade-regulated timber. The procedure for rapid structure determination of NPSs combines neutral loss mass spectral information from DART-HRMS data acquired at multiple voltages under collision-induced dissociation (CID) conditions, thereby resulting in varying levels of molecule fragmentation. This approach falls under the umbrella of “data fusion”, which is a strategy that combines the output from multiple data sets in order to improve the accuracy of the results. A second focus on psychoactive substances is the development of the Database of Psychoactive Plants (DoPP). This tool is designed to be user-friendly and includes an architecture for identifying plant unknowns. The application is based on the observation that plants display specific chemical signatures that are detectable by DART-HRMS. The subsequent automated machine learning processing of libraries of these spectra enabled the rapid discrimination and identification of species, resulting in a chemical signature database containing 57 available plant species. Another focus of this work is the development of an analysis approach to be used in a wildlife forensics context. Depending on the species, trade in timber can be totally or heavily restricted. A current technique used by law enforcement to differentiate species of wood is DART-HRMS, coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. Although this method is useful in a laboratory setting, it is impractical in field applications (such as for the determination of timber species identity in shipping containers at ports). The added dimension of wood headspace analysis by solid phase microextraction (SPME) was used to generate data to complement that acquired using the conventional wood analysis technique to facilitate the development of “stand-off” approaches for the differentiation of wood species based on their volatiles profiles."

    "pubDate": "2024-09-23T19:30:25.000Z",
    "contentSnippet": "In recent years, broad access to digital communication tools provided by the “tech boom” has forced arts and culture nonprofit organizations (ACNPO) to transition to social media and mobile applications to engage audiences. While various approaches focus on building breadth (i.e. recirculation of content) and depth (i.e. replies) of engagement, ACNPO use multimedia to spur discussion and dissemination of their mission. Dependent on individual donors who generally give in small amounts, ACNPO are reliant on effective and visual social media campaigns to drive virality and broaden marketing appeal. Yet questions remain whether the presence of multimedia-inclusive posts (MIP) generates broader and deeper engagement, with conflicting theories pointing to both increased and decreased engagement. This study leverages quantitative approaches and the historical Twitter timelines of the top 20 ANCPOs (based on visitation records) in North America to address three key questions. First, do MIP increase engagement breadth, measured by the number of likes and retweets a single post receives? Second, do MIP increase engagement depth, measured by the number of replies generated? Finally, does the presence of MIP simultaneously influence both breadth and depth of engagement, measured by the number of quote tweets? The proposed research also aims to identify how the use of MIP over time changes as ACNPO use MIP more frequently and MIP become more commonplace in the broader social media ecosystem.\nThe findings of this research will present both practical and academic significance. First, there is no known research examining the usage of MIP by ACNPO to build engagement with audiences on Twitter. Therefore, this dissertation will add to the growing literature around social media engagement in general and the use of social media by ACNPO more specifically. Second, effective social media campaigns allow ACNPO to spread awareness about their services to a global audience without the financial burden of traditional means such as printed products. By highlighting the dynamic relationships between MIP and different types of engagement, the results of this dissertation can also inform new social media engagement strategies by ACNPO to increase breadth and depth of future engagement, and hopefully, generate a larger audience for their services."

    "link": "https://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/blog/post/reflecting_on_the_internet_worm_at_35/",
    "pubDate": null,
    "contentSnippet": "Thirty-five  years ago today (November 2nd), the Internet Worm program was set loose to propagate on the Internet.  Noting that now to the computing public (and cybersecurity professionals, specifically) often generates an \"Oh, really?\" response akin to stating that November 2nd is the anniversary of the inaugural broadcast of the first BBC TV channel (1936), and the launch of Sputnik 2 with Laika aboard (1957).  That is, to many, it is ho-hum, ancient history.\nPerhaps that is to be expected after 35 years -- approximately the length of a human generation. (As an aside, I have been teaching at Purdue for 36 years. I have already taught students whose parents had taken one of my classes as a student; in five or so years, I may see students whose grandparents took one of my classes!). In 1988, fewer than 100,000 machines were likely connected to the Internet; thus, only a few thousand people were involved in systems administration and security. For us, the events were more profound, but we are outnumbered by today's user population; many of us have retired from the field...and more than a few have passed on. Thus, events of decades ago have become ancient history for current users.\nNonetheless, the event and its aftermath were profound for those who lived through it. No major security incident had ever occurred on such a scale before.  The Worm was the top news story in international media for days. The events retold in Cliff Stoll's Cuckoo's Egg were only a few years earlier but had affected far fewer systems. However, that tale of computer espionage heightened concern by authorities in the days following the Worm's deployment regarding its origin and purpose. It seeded significant changes in law enforcement, defense funding and planning, and how we all looked at interconnectivity. In the following years, malware (and especially non-virus malware) became an increasing problem, from Code Red and Nimda to today's botnets and ransomware. All of that eventually led to a boom in add-on security measures, resulting in what is now a multi-billion dollar cybersecurity industry. \nAt the time of the Worm, the study of computing security (the term \"cybersecurity\" had not yet appeared) was primarily based around cryptography, formal verification of program correctness, and limiting covert channels.  The Worm illustrated that there was a larger scope needed, although it took additional events (such as the aforementioned worms and malware) to drive the message home.  Until the late 1990s, many people still believed  cybersecurity was simply a matter of attentive cyber hygiene and not an independent, valid field of study. (I frequently encountered this attitude in academic circles, and was told it was present in the discussion leading to my tenure. That may seem difficult to believe today, but should not be surprising: Purdue has the oldest degree-granting CS department [60 years old this year], and it was initially viewed by some as simply glorified accounting! It is often the case that outsiders dismiss an emerging discipline as trivial or irrelevant.) \nThe Worm provided us with an object lesson about many issues that, unfortunately, were not heeded in full to this day.  That multi-billion dollar cybersecurity industry is still failing to protect far too many of our systems.  Among those lessons:\nInterconnected systems with long-lasting access (e.g., .rshrc files) created a playground for lateral movement across enterprises.  We knew then that good security practice involved fully mediated access (now often referred to as \"Zero Trust\") and had known that for some time.  However, convenience was viewed as more important than security...a problem that continues to vex us to this day.  We continue to build systems that both enable effortless lateral movement, and  make it difficult or annoying for users to reauthenticate, thus leading them to bypass the checks.\nSystems without separation of privilege facilitated the spread of malware.  Current attackers who manage to penetrate key services or privileged accounts are able to gain broader access to entire networks, including the ability to shut off monitoring and updates.  We have proven methods of limiting access (SELinux is one example) but they are too infrequently used. \nSharing information across organizations can result in a more robust, more timely response.  Today, we still have organizations that refuse to disclose if they have been compromised, thus delaying our societal response; information obtained by government agencies has too often been classified, or at least closely held.. The information that is shared is frequently incomplete or not timely. \nThe use of type-unsafe languages with minimal security features can lead to flaws that may be exploited.  One only needs to survey recent CVE entries and attack reports to see buffer overflows, type mismatches, and other well-known software flaws leading to compromise.  Many organizations are still producing or reusing software written in C or C++ that are especially prone to such errors.  Sadly, higher education is complicit by teaching those languages as primary, mainly because their graduates may not be employable without them.\nHeterogenity of systems provides some bulwark against common attacks.  Since 1988, the number of standard operating systems in use has decreased, as has the underlying machine architectures. There are clearly economic arguments for reduced numbers of platforms, but the homogeneity facilitates common attacks. Consideration of when to reuse and when to build new is sadly infrequent.\nThe Worm incident generated conflicting signals about the propriety of hacking into other people's systems and writing malware.  Some people who knew the Worm's author rose to his defense, claiming he was demonstrating security problems and not doing anything wrong. Malware authors and system attackers commonly made that same claim in the decades following, with mixed responses from the community. It still colors the thinking of many in the field, justifying some very dubious behavior as somehow justified by results. Although there is nuance in some discussions, the grey areas around pen testing, companies selling spyware, and \"ethical\" hacking still enable plausible explanations for bad behavior.\nThat last point is  important as we  debate the dangers and adverse side-effects of machine learning/LLM/AI systems.  Those are being refined and deployed by people claiming they are not responsible for the (mis)use of (or errors in) those systems and that their economic potential outweighs any social costs.  We have failed to clearly understand and internalize that not everything that can be done  should be done, especially in the Internet at large.  This is an issue that keeps coming up and we continue to fail to address it properly.\nAs a field, cybersecurity is relatively young.  We have a history that arguably starts in the 1960s with the Ware Report.  We are still discovering what is involved in protecting systems, data privacy, and safety.  Heck, we still need a commonly accepted definition of what cybersecurity entails! (Cf. Chapter 1 of the Cybersecurity Myths book, referenced below.). The first cybersecurity degree program wasn't established until 2000 (at Purdue).  We still lack useful metrics to know whether we are making significant progress and titrate investment. And we are still struggling with tools and techniques to create and maintain secure systems.  All this while the market (and thus need) is expanding globally.\nIn that context of growth and need, we should not dismiss the past as \"Ho-hum, history.\" Members of the military study historic battles to avoid future mistakes: mentioning the Punic Wars or The Battle of Thermopylae to such a scholar will not result in dismissal with \"Not relevant.\"  If you are interested in cybersecurity, it would be advisable to study some history of the field and think about lessons learned -- and unlearned.\nFurther Reading\nThe Ware Report\nThis can be seen as one of the first descriptions of cybersecurity challenges, needs and approaches.\n\nThe protection of information in computer systems\nA paper from 1975 by J.H. Saltzer and M.D. Schroeder.  This paper refers to basic design principles, in large part inspired by Multics, that include complete mediation (now somewhat captured by \"Zero Trust\") and least privilege.  These are most often violated by software rather than designed in, especially economy of mechanism. \n (Versions of this paper may be found outside the paywall via web search engines.)\n\nHistorical papers archive\nA collection of historical papers presenting the early foundation of cybersecurity.  This includes the Ware Report, and its follow-on, the Anderson Report.  Some other, hard-to-find items are here.\n\nThe Communications of the ACM Worm Issue\nAn issue of CACM was devoted to papers about the Worm.\n\nThe Internet Worm: An Analysis\nMy full report analyzing what the Worm program did and how it was structured.\n\nThe Internet Worm Incident\nA report describing the timeline of the Worm release, spread, discovery, and response.\n\nHappy birthday, dear viruses\nThis is a short article in Science I coauthored with Richard Ford for the 25th anniversary of the Worm, about malware generally.\n\nCybersecurity Myths and Misconceptions\nA new book about things the public and even cybersecurity experts mistakenly believe about cybersecurity.  Chapter 1 addresses, in depth, how we do not have an accepted definition of cybersecurity or metrics to measure it.  Other items alluded to in this blog post are also addressed in the book.\n\nCyber security challenges and windmills\nOne of my blog posts, from 2009, about how we continue to generate studies of what would improve cybersecurity and then completely fail to heed them.  The situation has not improved in the years since then."
