        "title": "Europol Dismantles MATRIX: The Encrypted Messaging Service Fueling Global Crime",
        "description": "<p><img alt=\"MATRIX\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"850\" src=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/MATRIX.webp\" title=\"Europol Dismantles MATRIX: The Encrypted Messaging Service Fueling Global Crime 3\" width=\"1280\" /></p>On December 3rd, 2024, Europol announced that a joint investigation between French and Dutch law enforcement authorities had successfully dismantled an encrypted messaging service used by criminals. The platform, known as <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/?s=MATRIX\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MATRIX</a>, had been facilitating various serious crimes, including international drug trafficking, arms trafficking, and money laundering.\n\nThe operation, which was coordinated by <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/international-operation-takes-down-another-encrypted-messaging-service-used-criminals\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">law enforcement across several European countries</a>, resulted in the seizure of over 40 servers, the arrest of multiple suspects, and the interception of millions of criminal messages. The investigation was a major step forward in combating the use of encrypted platforms for illegal activities.\n<h3>MATRIX: A Sophisticated Criminal Platform</h3>\nMATRIX, a messaging platform made by criminals for criminals, was first discovered on the phone of a convicted criminal involved in the 2021 murder of Dutch investigative journalist Peter R. de Vries. The journalist had gained fame for his work covering unsolved crimes. This discovery led <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/dutch-dpa-fine-on-clearview-ai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch</a> authorities to initiate an extensive investigation into the platform, which was found to be more complex and sophisticated than other similar platforms such as Sky ECC and EncroChat.\n\nUnlike many encrypted communication services, MATRIX requires users to be invited in order to join the platform. It offered a range of encrypted features, including secure messaging, voice and video calls, and even anonymous web browsing. MATRIX also had its own currency system for users to pay for subscriptions, and its platform was primarily used on <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cellular-modem-vulnerabilities/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google Pixel phones</a>. This level of sophistication and exclusivity made it a popular choice among criminals.\n<h3>The Role of International Cooperation</h3>\nThe dismantling of MATRIX highlights the importance of international cooperation in the fight against organized crime. Authorities from France, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, and Spain worked together as part of a joint investigation team (JIT) coordinated through Eurojust. This cross-border collaboration allowed law enforcement agencies to exchange vital information and swiftly take coordinated action.\n\nFor three months, investigators monitored activity on the platform, deciphering over 2.3 million messages in 33 different languages. The intercepted communications provided valuable intelligence, linking MATRIX users to various criminal activities. These included international drug smuggling, arms deals, and large-scale money laundering schemes.\n\nOn December 3rd, the operation led to the takedown of the platform\u2019s servers located across France and Germany. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2024/december/3/11-opnieuw-versleutelde-communicatiedienst-criminelen-ontmanteld.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">authorities conducted raids</a> in multiple countries, arresting three individuals. One suspect, identified as the suspected owner and operator of MATRIX, a 52-year-old Lithuanian national, was apprehended in Spain. He had been working closely with a 30-year-old man from the Netherlands to run the platform.\n<h3>Significant Seizures and Evidence</h3>\nDuring the raids, police seized \u20ac145,000 ($152,000) in cash and approximately \u20ac500,000 ($527,000) in cryptocurrencies. Authorities also confiscated four vehicles, more than 970 mobile phones, and other equipment. The evidence collected during the operation will be crucial in ongoing investigations into the criminals who used MATRIX to facilitate illegal activities.\n\nIn addition to the physical evidence, the seizure of the platform\u2019s servers provided law enforcement with a significant opportunity to collect <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-data/\" title=\"data\">data</a> related to the communications and transactions conducted via MATRIX. A splash page now appears on the platform\u2019s website, alerting users that their messages were intercepted by authorities. The <a href=\"https://www.operation-passionflower.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">page includes</a> a warning: \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time and will not be the last time we are able to read the messages in real time.\"\n<h3>Law Enforcement Involved</h3>\nThe dismantling of MATRIX involved the coordinated efforts of several European <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/operation-magnus-redline-and-meta-infostealer/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">law enforcement agencies</a>, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>France:</strong> JUNALCO National Jurisdiction against Organised Crime; OFAC National Police <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/\" title=\"Cybercrime\">Cybercrime</a> Division</li>\n \t<li><strong>Netherlands:</strong> Team High <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/tech-scam/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tech\">Tech</a> Crime of the National Investigations; Special Operations (NIS) of the Netherlands Police; Netherlands Public Prosecution Service</li>\n \t<li><strong>Germany:</strong> Frankfurt am Main Public Prosecutor General's Office \u2013 ZIT; German Federal Criminal Police, Serious and Organised Crime Division</li>\n \t<li><strong>Italy:</strong> National Antimafia Directorate (D.N.A.); Central Directorate for Anti-Drug Services (D.C.S.A.)</li>\n \t<li><strong>Lithuania:</strong> Prosecutor General\u2019s Office; Lithuanian Criminal Police Bureau</li>\n \t<li><strong>Spain:</strong> Central Investigative Court 1 and 5 of Audiencia Nacional; Spanish National Police</li>\n</ul>\nThe operation was also supported by Europol\u2019s Operational Task Force, which was established to monitor criminal activity on encrypted platforms like MATRIX. The task force played a crucial role in providing technical and operational support during the investigation.\n<h3>An Evolving Cybersecurity Landscape</h3>\nThe takedown of MATRIX adds to a growing list of encrypted criminal communication platforms that have been disrupted in recent years. Prior to MATRIX, law enforcement successfully dismantled Sky ECC and EncroChat, two other popular platforms used by cybercriminals. These operations have demonstrated the ability of law enforcement agencies to infiltrate and shut down encrypted communication services that criminals rely on to carry out illegal activities.\n\nHowever, as criminals adapt to the disruption of their communication tools, law enforcement faces an increasingly fragmented landscape. Criminals have turned to less-established or custom-built encrypted platforms, which offer varying levels of security and anonymity. Despite this challenge, the successful takedown of MATRIX sends a strong message that authorities are constantly evolving their tactics to stay ahead of cybercriminals.",

        "description": "<p><img alt=\"CISA\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/CISA-2.webp\" title=\"Telecoms on High Alert: New Cybersecurity Guidelines to Defend Against PRC-Affiliated Threats 5\" width=\"1280\" /></p><div class=\"flex max-w-full flex-col flex-grow\">\n<div class=\"min-h-8 text-message flex w-full flex-col items-end gap-2 whitespace-normal break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5\" dir=\"auto\">\n<div class=\"flex w-full flex-col gap-1 empty:hidden first:pt-[3px]\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and their international partners have released a comprehensive set of guidelines aimed at enhancing the<a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/most-exploited-vulnerability/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> security of telecommunications</a> infrastructure.\n\nThe joint publication, titled <em>Enhanced Visibility and Hardening Guidance for Communications Infrastructure</em>, offers critical advice to network engineers and defenders tasked with protecting global communications networks from advanced persistent threats (APTs) tied to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\n<h3>The Cyber Espionage Threat</h3>\nThe new guidance comes in the wake of warnings issued by <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cisa-releases-security-capabilities-catalog/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CISA</a> and the <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/us-election-2024-security-enhance-by-fbi/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FBI</a> about an ongoing, broad <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cyberattack-on-the-indian-air-force/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cyber espionage</a> campaign conducted by <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/t-mobile-chinese-telecom-network-breaches/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">PRC-affiliated threat actors</a>. These cybercriminals have successfully <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-fbi-and-cisa-peoples-republic-china-prc-targeting-commercial-telecommunications\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">infiltrated the networks of major telecommunications providers</a> worldwide, compromising sensitive data and potentially jeopardizing national security, critical infrastructure, and private businesses. The objective of the campaign, as detailed by officials, is to extract valuable information for intelligence-gathering purposes.\n\nJeff Greene, Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity at CISA, <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-nsa-fbi-and-international-partners-publish-guide-protecting-communications-infrastructure\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">emphasized</a> the seriousness of the threat: \u201cThe PRC-affiliated cyber activity poses a serious threat to critical infrastructure, government agencies, and businesses. This guide will help telecommunications and other organizations detect and prevent compromises by the PRC and other <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cyber-news/\" title=\"cyber\">cyber</a> actors.\u201d\n<h3>A Call to Action for Network Defenders</h3>\nThe newly released guide outlines a series of best practices designed to help organizations strengthen their networks against <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/annual-cyber-threat-report-2023-2024/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cyber threats</a>. While tailored primarily for the telecommunications sector, these recommendations are applicable to any organization operating critical infrastructure, including businesses with on-premises enterprise equipment.\n\nOne of the central themes of the guidance is the importance of enhancing <em>visibility</em> within networks. This refers to the ability of network defenders to detect and analyze activity across their systems, including network traffic, user behaviors, and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-data/\" title=\"data\">data</a> flows. High visibility ensures that potential threats can be quickly identified and mitigated before they lead to serious breaches.\n<h3>Strengthening Visibility in Communications Infrastructure</h3>\nTo improve visibility, CISA and the FBI recommend that network engineers implement strong monitoring systems and processes to detect anomalous behaviors or unauthorized changes in network configurations. These recommendations include:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Monitoring Configuration Changes</strong>: Network engineers are advised to closely track changes to critical network devices like routers, firewalls, and switches, especially those that occur outside of established change management protocols. Unusual alterations, such as unauthorized route updates or the activation of weak protocols, should trigger alerts for immediate investigation.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Centralized Configuration Management</strong>: Storing device configurations centrally, instead of relying on the devices themselves, helps ensure a single, trusted source of truth for network settings. Frequent testing and validation of configurations are also encouraged to ensure they remain secure and effective.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Monitoring User and Service Accounts</strong>: Suspicious logins, particularly those from unknown or unexpected sources, should be closely monitored. It's also important to regularly review and disable inactive accounts to reduce the attack surface.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Secure Logging and Data Analysis</strong>: Implementing centralized logging, where log data is securely stored and can be easily analyzed, helps identify <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/\" title=\"security\">security</a> incidents faster. Encrypted log transmission is essential to prevent tampering or interception.</li>\n</ul>\nBy improving <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-network-security/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">network visibility</a>, defenders can identify threats early in their lifecycle and respond to them more effectively, reducing the risk of a successful compromise.\n<h3>Hardening Systems and Devices</h3>\nAlongside increasing visibility, the guide stresses the importance of hardening network systems and devices. This means reducing <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/drinking-water-systems-cybersecurity/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vulnerabilities</a> through secure configuration practices and implementing defense-in-depth strategies that limit potential entry points for cyber actors.\n\nKey recommendations for hardening devices include:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Out-of-Band Management</strong>: Network engineers should manage devices through a physically separate management network, isolated from the operational data flow. This limits the potential for <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-lateral-movement-in-cyber-security/\" title=\"lateral movement\">lateral movement</a> by attackers in case of a compromised device.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Strict Access Controls</strong>: Implementing default-deny access control lists (ACLs) and network segmentation can block unauthorized traffic and isolate critical systems. Devices with sensitive functions, such as DNS servers or email servers, should be placed in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) to further reduce the <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-are-risks-in-cybersecurity/\" title=\"risk\">risk</a> of exposure.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Use of Strong Encryption</strong>: Strong encryption practices should be employed across all traffic, particularly for VPNs and remote management tools. <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-are-vulnerabilities/\" title=\"Vulnerabilities\">Vulnerabilities</a> in outdated encryption protocols should be mitigated by using the latest cryptographic standards, such as AES-256 and TLS 1.3.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Disabling Unnecessary Services</strong>: Services like Telnet, FTP, and older versions of SSH should be disabled, as they are often targeted by attackers looking for weak entry points into the network.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Regular Updates and Patching</strong>: It is essential to keep all devices and software up-to-date with the latest security patches. Additionally, network defenders should regularly monitor vendor announcements for end-of-life (EOL) notifications and upgrade equipment accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\nBy hardening network devices and systems, organizations can make it significantly more difficult for threat actors to <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/exploit/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"exploit\">exploit</a> vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to critical networks.\n<h3>CISA, NSA, and FBI: A Unified Effort to Safeguard Critical Infrastructure</h3>\nIn conclusion, the <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-cybersecurity/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"cybersecurity\">cybersecurity</a> agencies behind the guide\u2014CISA, NSA, and FBI\u2014are urging all organizations, especially those involved in critical infrastructure, to adopt these best practices. As Jeff Greene highlighted, it is crucial for software manufacturers to integrate <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cisa-ai-red-teaming/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Secure by Design</em> </a>principles into their development processes to ensure that future vulnerabilities are minimized.\n\nBryan Vorndran, Assistant Director of the FBI\u2019s Cyber Division, also stressed the importance of collaborative action: \u201cTogether with our interagency partners, the FBI issued guidance to enhance the visibility of network defenders and to harden devices against PRC exploitation.\u201d\n\nUltimately, this guidance not only aims to defend against PRC-affiliated actors but also to enhance the overall security posture of telecommunications infrastructure and other critical sectors. By implementing these measures, network defenders can better prepare for and respond to evolving cyber threats, helping to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of essential services.\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

        "title": "Save Big This Season: Practical Tips for Stress-Free Shopping",
        "description": "<p><img alt=\"Black Friday\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/Black-Friday-Shopping.webp\" title=\"Save Big This Season: Practical Tips for Stress-Free Shopping 7\" width=\"1500\" /></p><a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/black-fridays-dirty-secret/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Black Friday</a> is the best, right? Well, sometimes. Deals everywhere, and chaos too. I\u2019ve had moments feeling so lost in the sea of discounts it almost made me give up shopping altogether. But over the years, I\u2019ve learned a few tricks. Here\u2019s how I handle it, step by step\u2014no fluff, just what works.\n\nFrom figuring out what I want in advance to using apps that do the heavy lifting, these tips can help make Black Friday more about saving than stressing.\n<h3>1. <strong>Start with Research</strong></h3>\nBefore I even think about shopping, I get organized. Not too much work, but enough to save headaches later. I jot down exactly what I want: brands, sizes, model numbers, and all that. Last year, I skipped this and wasted hours online. Learned my lesson. Now, I look at online reviews, compare specs, and even save product links on my phone.\n\nHonestly, the key is knowing what to expect price-wise. Retailers are sneaky. \u201c50% off\u201d isn\u2019t a deal if they jacked up prices last month. I bookmark price trackers and keep an eye out for weeks before the sales start. Apps like Honey or CamelCamelCamel are game-changers.\n<h3>2. <strong>Subscribe to Newsletters (Yes, Really)</strong></h3>\nSome people hate spam. Me? I use it. Signing up for store emails means you hear about discounts first. I don\u2019t check them daily, but during the <a href=\"https://www.expressvpn.com/blog/black-friday-vpn/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Black Friday</a> season, those emails are pure gold. Some stores send early access links to deals. I got my headphones that way last year\u2014saved $70 before most people even knew they were discounted.\n\nA quick tip: turn on app notifications for stores like Target or Amazon. I used to hate push alerts, but now they let me catch limited-time offers I\u2019d otherwise miss. Life\u2019s too short to be refreshing pages all day.\n<h3>3. <strong>The Coupons App Is a Lifesaver</strong></h3>\nEver heard of The Coupons App? It\u2019s fantastic. I downloaded it when a friend wouldn\u2019t stop talking about it, and wow. It doesn\u2019t just find promo codes\u2014it applies them to you. It\u2019s like magic. I\u2019ve even snagged freebies nearby, like a free coffee once. The app also tracks price drops. That\u2019s how I got a laptop at $150 off without stalking sales all month.\n\nNo app is perfect, though. Sometimes, codes don\u2019t work, or deals are region-specific. But on the whole, it\u2019s a superb choice. Little savings add up over time.\n<h3>4. <strong>Loyalty Programs Pay Off</strong></h3>\nI used to ignore loyalty cards, thinking they weren\u2019t worth it. Big mistake. Stores like Old Navy or Macy\u2019s give members discounts others don\u2019t get. A lot of them let you earn points too, which can translate to free money later. I\u2019ve scored free shirts and even got a $20 store credit once\u2014just for shopping during Black Friday.\n<h3>5. <strong>Price Comparison: The Secret Weapon</strong></h3>\nImpulse buys are tempting, but not every sale is as good as it looks. I use apps like <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/google-fraud-protection-pilot-in-india/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a> Price Scanner to compare prices. It\u2019s quick and makes me feel like I\u2019m not being ripped off. Did you know some stores price-match too? Best Buy does, but only if you ask. I\u2019ve walked up to customer service and gotten refunds on price differences just because I checked.\n\nOne more thing: don\u2019t stop comparing prices after Black Friday. <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/best-cyber-monday-deals-2022/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cyber Monday often has better deals</a> on tech. Missed the sale? No worries, because stores tend to extend discounts all weekend.\n<h3>6. <strong>Understand Return Policies</strong></h3>\nReturns can save you big time. Keep every receipt, digital or paper. Why? If a price drops after you buy something, you can sometimes get a refund for the difference. I\u2019ve done this at Target and even Walmart. Some stores give you until January to return items bought during holiday sales. It\u2019s like a safety net. If I find something cheaper later, I\u2019ll just return the pricier version.\n\nOne little <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-hacking/\" title=\"hack\">hack</a>: buy the lower-priced item and return the expensive one. A bit tedious but totally worth it for bigger savings.\n<h3>7. <strong>Stick to Online Shopping</strong></h3>\nShopping in-store is rarely worth it anymore. I\u2019ve skipped the crowds the past few years and don\u2019t regret it. Online, I can compare deals from my couch\u2014no lines, no pushing, no stress. Sites even offer web-exclusive sales that beat in-store prices. Just don\u2019t forget to double-check shipping deadlines. Missed packages are the worst.\n<h3>8. <strong>Timing Is Everything</strong></h3>\nNot every deal drops on Black Friday. Some stores start sales early\u2014like mid-November. If I spot a decent price a week before, I\u2019ll buy it. Why <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-are-risks-in-cybersecurity/\" title=\"risk\">risk</a> waiting for a better deal when I might lose out completely? Also, don\u2019t sleep on Wednesday before Black Friday. Weird, but true: it\u2019s often quieter and less competitive.\n<h3>9. <strong>Doorbusters: Worth It?</strong></h3>\nLet me be real: I\u2019m over doorbusters. Camping out all night for one TV? Not my vibe. But if you <em>do</em> go in person, get there at dawn\u2014or earlier. The crowds aren\u2019t as crazy as they used to be, but the best deals still vanish fast. Once, I tried going mid-morning, and half the stock was gone. Never again.\n<h3>10. <strong>Don\u2019t Forget Gift Cards</strong></h3>\nIf you have unused gift cards lying around, now\u2019s the time to use them. I\u2019ve bought discounted cards from websites and used them during sales for extra savings. Think about it: buying $50 worth of stuff but only paying $40 because of a gift card? Feels like winning twice.\n<h3>11. <strong>Have Fun, But Set Limits</strong></h3>\n<a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/ncsc-warns-of-fraud-risk-on-black-friday/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Black Friday</a> is electrifying, but it\u2019s easy to splurge. I always set a budget now. Not just for big purchases, but for everything. Snacks, small gifts, stocking stuffers\u2014it all adds up. The goal is to <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-save-money\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">save money</a>, not blow it.\n\nBlack Friday doesn\u2019t have to be stressful. Do a little prep, use the right tools, and focus on what you need, not just what\u2019s cheap. That\u2019s how I make it through without feeling overwhelmed\u2014or broke.",

        "title": "Apple Faces Privacy Lawsuit: Employee Alleges Invasive Device Monitoring",
        "description": "<p><img alt=\"Apple lawsuit\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/Apple-lawsuit.webp\" title=\"Apple Faces Privacy Lawsuit: Employee Alleges Invasive Device Monitoring 9\" width=\"1920\" /></p><span>A current Apple employee has filed a lawsuit against the tech giant, accusing the company of using invasive surveillance tactics on its workers\u2019 personal devices. The Apple lawsuit, filed on Sunday evening in California state court, puts allegations that Apple monitors employees\u2019 private iCloud accounts and non-work-related devices without their consent.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The plaintiff, Amar Bhakta, has been employed by Apple in the advertising technology sector since 2020. Bhakta claims that Apple\u2019s policies force employees to surrender their <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-privacy/\" title=\"privacy\">privacy</a> rights, enabling the company to conduct \u201cphysical, video, and electronic surveillance\u201d of workers not just during their working hours, but also when they are off-duty and even after they leave the company. The suit alleges that these practices violate California's strict <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/data-privacy-laws-in-australia/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">privacy laws</a>.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Bhakta's legal action points to a broader issue regarding Apple\u2019s employment practices, accusing the company of creating policies that infringe on the personal privacy of its employees. The suit outlines a range of policies that allegedly place Apple employees under constant scrutiny, both on and off the job.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>The Apple Lawsuit: Invasive Surveillance Tactics</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>According to the Apple lawsuit, the <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/tech-scam/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"tech\">tech</a> giant has established policies that force employees to integrate their work and personal lives digitally in ways that allow the company to monitor their actions beyond the workplace. One of the central issues raised in the lawsuit is Apple\u2019s requirement that employees use Apple-made devices for work purposes. This stipulation, the suit argues, often results in workers using their personal Apple devices, which are connected to their personal iCloud accounts.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>According to <a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/12/02/2024/employee-lawsuit-accuses-apple-of-spying-on-its-workers\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Semafor</a>, t</span><span>he lawsuit further claims that by using their own devices for work, employees unknowingly grant Apple the ability to access virtually any data on those devices. This includes emails, photos, videos, and other <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/protect-personal-information-from-scammers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">personal information</a>. Apple\u2019s internal privacy policy allegedly states that if an employee uses their personal iCloud account on an Apple-managed device, the company can search and access any <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-data/\" title=\"data\">data</a> stored on that device, including real-time location data.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>This level of access has raised concerns among former Apple employees, who have previously complained about the company\u2019s ability to monitor <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/protect-personal-information-from-scammers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">personal information</a>. </span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>Apple\u2019s Response and Legal Representation</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>In response to the Apple lawsuit, the firm has strongly denied the allegations, insisting that the company upholds its employees' rights to privacy. Every employee has the right to discuss their wages, hours, and working conditions, and this is part of our business conduct policy, which all employees are trained on annually,\" the company said in a statement.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Bhakta is represented by Chris Baker of Baker Dolinko &amp; Schwartz, alongside Jahan Sagafi from Outten &amp; Golden. Both attorneys have experience in handling high-profile cases against large technology companies. Baker, in particular, has filed several lawsuits against tech giants concerning allegedly unlawful employment practices.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>Impact on Employee Freedom and Privacy</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>The lawsuit against Apple also highlights the restrictive nature of the company's policies regarding digital privacy. The suit claims that Apple actively discourages employees from maintaining separate work and personal iCloud accounts. Instead, employees are encouraged to use a single iCloud account that merges their work and personal lives, thereby granting Apple more access to their private information.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>This digital integration, according to the lawsuit, creates an environment in which Apple can monitor employees\u2019 personal activities even when they are off the clock. Employees are said to have limited options to avoid this surveillance, with the only alternative being to use a work-owned device and a separate iCloud account exclusively for work purposes. However, the suit asserts that Apple discourages this practice.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>Legal Action Under California\u2019s Labor Laws</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>Bhakta\u2019s lawsuit was filed under the California Private Attorneys <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/general/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"General\">General</a> Act (PAGA), which permits employees to sue on behalf of the state for labor violations. If the court finds Apple guilty of violating state labor laws, the company could be subjected to <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/t-mobile-national-security-agreement-breaches/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">penalties</a>, which would be multiplied by the number of employees affected by the alleged surveillance.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>This lawsuit against Apple highlights ongoing concerns over digital privacy in the workplace. As more employees find themselves bound by the company's restrictive policies, the case has the potential to set a precedent for how tech companies handle employee surveillance and <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/hong-kong-cybersecurity-bill/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">personal privacy</a>. With the backing of California state law, Bhakta\u2019s legal team aims to hold Apple accountable for any violations, especially if the company's actions have impacted a large number of its employees.</span><span>\u00a0</span>",

The catalog\u2019s goal is to guide agencies in implementing secure network environments and ensuring compliance with <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/wyden-urged-hhs-higher-cybersecurity-standards/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cybersecurity standards</a>. </span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>With the rapid shift to more complex computing environments, the SCC ensures that agencies can adapt to new risks while maintaining <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/\" title=\"security\">security</a> measures across a variety of computing environments, including cloud, mobile, and on-premises infrastructures.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span><a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/TIC%203.0%20Security%20Capabilities%20Catalog508%20v3.2%20%28Volume%203%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Version 3.2 of the TIC 3.0 SCC</a> builds on previous releases by integrating the latest updates from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The CSF, w</span><span>hich provides a structured approa</span><span>ch to managing <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-cybersecurity/\" title=\"cybersecurity\">cybersecurity</a> risks, is based around the core functions of Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. These functions are vital to organizations\u2019 <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-risk-management/\" title=\"risk management\">risk management</a> strategies and are now reflected in the updated catalog\u2019s security capabilities, ensuring that TIC aligns with best practices in managing cybersecurity risks, detecting incidents, and responding to threats.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>Key Security Objectives of TIC 3.0</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>The TIC 3.0 program outlines specific security objectives aimed at mitigating risks as federal <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-data/\" title=\"data\">data</a> moves through various trust zones, especially with the increasing use of cloud and mobile services. These objectives are designed to provide scalable and consistent protections, regardless of the data's location or transmission method. </span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The updated Security Capabilities Catalog helps agencies implement these objectives, ensuring secure management of federal data. One key objective is Manage Traffic, which focuses on filtering data connections to ensure they align with authorized activities, enforcing least privilege and default-deny policies to restrict access to sensitive data.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>\u00a0Another important goal is to Protect Traffic Confidentiality, ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential during transit by securing communication channels to prevent <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/hugging-face-discloses-unauthorized-access/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unauthorized access</a>. Protect Traffic Integrity aims to ensure that data in transit remains unaltered, protecting it from tampering by <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/dumbest-thing-in-security-things-hackers-do/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cybercriminals</a>. </span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Finally, the objective to Ensure Effective Response stresses the need for timely action to mitigate damage during <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-cybersecurity/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"cybersecurity\">cybersecurity</a> incidents and adapt security policies to address online threats.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>Universal and PEP Security Capabilities</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>The updated SCC divides security capabilities into two primary categories: Universal Security Capabilities and PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) Security Capabilities. Both categories are essential for helping federal agencies secure their networks and implement effective <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-are-risks-in-cybersecurity/\" title=\"risk\">risk</a> management measures.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h4><b><span>Universal Security Capabilities</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h4>\n<span>Universal security capabilities are high-level principles that apply to all federal agencies, regardless of their specific use cases, helping them implement broad cybersecurity measures to address enterprise-level risks. Key universal capabilities in the catalog include Backup and Recovery, which ensures that data and configurations are backed up and can be restored in the event of an incident, failure, or corruption. </span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Central Log Management with Analysis is another critical capability, collecting, storing, and analyzing security logs to support threat detection and forensic analysis. <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/post-incident-cybersecurity-legal-challenges/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Incident Response Planning</a> and Handling helps agencies prepare for and respond to cybersecurity incidents, ensuring quick recovery and detection measures are in place. </span>\n\n<span>The principle of Least Privilege limits access to the minimum necessary resources, reducing exposure to potential threats, while Patch Management ensures systems are regularly updated with patches to mitigate <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-are-vulnerabilities/\" title=\"vulnerabilities\">vulnerabilities</a> from known exploits.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h4><b><span>PEP Security Capabilities</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h4>\n<span>PEP security capabilities focus on technical implementations that are more granular and can be tailored to an agency's specific needs. These capabilities directly support the TIC 3.0 security objectives and align with emerging cybersecurity architectures, such as <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cybersecurity-with-zero-trust-networks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Zero Trust</a>. </span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Key examples include Anti-malware, which detects and quarantines malicious code that could compromise the integrity of the network, and Network Segmentation, which divides networks into smaller, isolated segments to limit the spread of <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cyber-news/\" title=\"cyber\">cyber</a> threats. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. </span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>These capabilities are essential for helping agencies implement targeted security measures across diverse environments, including cloud, email, and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-network-security/\" title=\"network security\">network security</a> solutions.</span><span>\u00a0</span>",

        "title": "CERT-In Alerts Multiple Vulnerabilities in Drupal Expose Systems",
        "description": "<p><img alt=\"Drupal Vulnerabilities\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/Drupal-Vulnerabilities.webp\" title=\"CERT-In Alerts Multiple Vulnerabilities in Drupal Expose Systems 13\" width=\"1280\" /></p><span>The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) issued a Vulnerability Note <a href=\"https://www.cert-in.org.in/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CIVN-2024-0353</a> highlighting several critical vulnerabilities within the widely used content management system (CMS), Drupal. The Drupal vulnerabilities, spanning versions from 7 to 11, have been </span><span>deemed to present a high security risk due to their potential for unauthorized access, arbitrary code execution, and exposure to data theft.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The flaws, which have been traced to improper handling of user inputs, inadequate sanitization in certain modules, and potential <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-are-vulnerabilities/\" title=\"vulnerabilities\">vulnerabilities</a> linked to PHP Object Injection, could allow attackers to compromise a site\u2019s integrity, gain access to sensitive data, or execute malicious scripts. </span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>Drupal Vulnerabilities Affected Versions and Risk Overview</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>Drupal, an open-source CMS, powers a number of websites, ranging from personal blogs to large organizational platforms. According to the <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/firewall-daily/vulnerabilities/\" title=\"vulnerability\">vulnerability</a> notes, multiple vulnerabilities exist in Drupal core due to flaws such as improper sanitization of status messages, failure to check certain user fields, and vulnerabilities that could allow PHP Object Injection. These flaws are particularly concerning for administrators running versions prior to:</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Drupal 7 (before version 7.102)</li>\n \t<li>Drupal 10.2 (before version 10.2.11)</li>\n \t<li>Drupal 10.3 (before version 10.3.9)</li>\n \t<li>Drupal 11.0 (before version 11.0.8)</li>\n</ul>\n<span>The primary concern is that these vulnerabilities could be exploited by remote attackers to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, execute arbitrary code, or even steal <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/wellintech-kinghistorian-user-vulnerability/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">sensitive user data</a>. For Drupal-based sites with outdated versions, these vulnerabilities can be exploited without requiring sophisticated technical knowledge from the attackers.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>Key Drupal Vulnerabilities and Exploits</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>One of the most critical Drupal vulnerabilities outlined in the report is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue, identified in SA-CORE-2024-003. This vulnerability affects versions from Drupal 8.8 to Drupal 10.2.11, Drupal 10.3.0 to Drupal 10.3.9, and Drupal 11.0.0 to Drupal 11.0.8. Drupal uses JavaScript to render status messages in some configurations, and in certain cases, these messages are not properly sanitized. This lack of sanitization opens the door for attackers to inject malicious scripts that could execute on the client side, compromising users\u2019 sessions or performing unauthorized actions on their behalf.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Another major vulnerability identified is an <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/critical-github-vulnerability-advisory/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Access Bypass issue</a>, found in SA-CORE-2024-004. This vulnerability, affecting versions 8.0.0 to 10.2.11, 10.3.0 to 10.3.9, and 11.0.0 to 11.0.8, arises due to inconsistent uniqueness checking for certain user fields. Depending on the database engine and collation settings, attackers could <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/exploit/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"exploit\">exploit</a> this flaw to allow multiple users to register with the same email address, leading to potential data integrity problems.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>More concerning vulnerabilities include PHP Object Injection issues described in SA-CORE-2024-006 and SA-CORE-2024-007. These vulnerabilities are considered less critical because they are not directly exploitable. However, if combined with another vulnerability, they could lead to <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/wpml-plugin-flaw-wordpress-rce/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">remote code execution</a> or arbitrary file deletion. The issue arises due to the improper handling of object deserialization. Although no direct exploits have been identified, administrators should still be vigilant, especially if their sites are using third-party database drivers.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>Impact Assessment and Solution Recommendations</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>The exploitation of these vulnerabilities in Drupal could lead to serious consequences, ranging from data theft to <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"malware\">malware</a> propagation. The potential for attackers to perform arbitrary code execution or manipulate user <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-data/\" title=\"data\">data</a> is a significant concern, especially for organizations that rely on Drupal to store sensitive or mission-critical information. Sites running outdated versions are at the greatest risk, and administrators are urged to act promptly.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>To mitigate these <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-are-risks-in-cybersecurity/\" title=\"risks\">risks</a>, Drupal administrators are strongly advised to update their systems to the latest versions. The <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/\" title=\"security\">security</a> updates are as follows:</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span>Update Drupal 7 to 7.102</span><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n \t<li><span>Update Drupal 10.2 to 10.2.11</span><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n \t<li><span>Update Drupal 10.3 to 10.3.9</span><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n \t<li><span>Update Drupal 11.0 to 11.0.8</span><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span>In addition to updating, Drupal administrators are encouraged to review their current configurations, especially when using custom modules or third-party applications that might interact with the Drupal core. This will help ensure that no existing vulnerabilities are overlooked, particularly those related to user input sanitization or unsafe object handling.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>Vendor Response and Ongoing Monitoring</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>The Drupal Security Team has been actively working on addressing these vulnerabilities. The initial reports and fixes were coordinated by team members such as </span>Lee Rowlands, Greg Knaddison, and Drew Webber<span>, with support from the broader Drupal security community. The latest security updates and patches are available from the official Drupal security advisories at:</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2024-003\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Drupal SA-CORE-2024-003</span></a><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2024-004\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Drupal SA-CORE-2024-004</span></a><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2024-005\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Drupal SA-CORE-2024-005</span></a><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2024-006\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Drupal SA-CORE-2024-006</span></a><span>\u00a0</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span>Additionally, the Drupal community has provided instructions for administrators to help them <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/android-security-bulletin-2023-security-fixes/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">patch and secure</a> their installations. The emphasis is on keeping up with CIVN-2024-0353 and other related advisories to reduce the risk of exploitation.</span><span>\u00a0</span>",

These proposed changes, part of the Communications and Multimedia (Amendments) Bill 2024 and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) (Amendment) Bill 2024, were introduced in the Dewan Rakyat for their first reading.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>These proposed amendments aim to update and strengthen Malaysia\u2019s <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cyber-news/\" title=\"cyber\">cyber</a> laws to address the challenges of the modern digital era. This initiative is part of the MADANI Government\u2019s broader efforts to create a safer online environment and to ensure that Malaysia remains at the forefront of digital innovation while protecting its citizens against\u00a0cybercrimes and online abuse.</span>\n<h3><b><span>Strengthening the Legal Framework for Cybersecurity</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>Fahmi Fadzil, who has been a vocal advocate for online safety, <a href=\"https://www.businesstoday.com.my/2024/12/02/govt-to-table-two-cybercrime-bills-in-parliament-today/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">denoted</a> that the MADANI Government's commitment to combatting cybercrimes and ensuring that the internet remains a safe space for all users. During his presentation in the Dewan Rakyat, the Minister explained that the amendments would address a broad spectrum of issues affecting the digital ecosystem, including social media misuse, <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/network-security-seize-missed-opportunities/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">network security</a>, and the overall development of the communications industry.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>One of the key provisions in the Communication and Multimedia (Amendments) Bill 2024 is the expansion of Section 233, which currently addresses the improper use of network facilities and services. The revised section will not only cover cases of harassment but also include offences involving <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/cybercrime/fraud/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"fraud\">fraud</a> or dishonesty against individuals, a much-needed update in today\u2019s digital environment. This change aims to better align the law with current online behaviors and practices, where cyberbullying, online fraud, and <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/identity-theft-how-to-prevent-recover-from-it/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">identity theft</a> are prevalent.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Additionally, Clause 92 proposes a new Section 233a, which would criminalize the sending, or authorizing the sending of, unsolicited commercial electronic messages. This provision is aimed at curbing the growing problem of spam and unsolicited marketing, which has become a nuisance for <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-internet/\" title=\"internet\">internet</a> users.</span>\n<h3><b><span>Enhancing the Role of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>Alongside the Communications and Multimedia (Amendments) Bill, the <a href=\"https://mcmc.gov.my/skmmgovmy/media/General/pdf2/NEAP-Amendment-Notice-No-1-of-2024.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) (Amendment) Bill 2024</a> was also presented by Fahmi. The amendments to the MCMC Bill are focused on expanding the Commission\u2019s role in overseeing Malaysia\u2019s digital infrastructure. </span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Under Clause 5, the functions of the MCMC would be expanded to include auditing information provided by licensees and service providers. This will ensure that companies in the communications sector adhere to regulations and maintain high standards of <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/\" title=\"security\">security</a> and integrity in their operations.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Clause 13 proposes an increase in the contract value limit for the MCMC from RM5 million to RM10 million, which would allow the Commission to enter into more substantial contracts without requiring ministerial approval. This change is expected to streamline the operations of the MCMC, enabling it to respond more effectively to the demands of the digital industry.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>Moreover, the MCMC (Amendment) Bill introduces new definitions for critical terms such as \"chief executive officer\" and \"communications system,\" while refining existing definitions, including that of the \"chairman.\" These changes reflect the growing complexity of the communications sector and are intended to ensure that the MCMC has the necessary authority and clarity to perform its functions effectively.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n<h3><b><span>Conclusion</span></b><span>\u00a0</span></h3>\n<span>The amendments to the Communications and Multimedia Act and the MCMC Act are expected to be passed during the current parliamentary session, which concludes on December 12, 2024. The amendments will come into effect on January 17, 2024, and will play an\u00a0important\u00a0role in shaping Malaysia\u2019s digital future.</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n<span>The introduction of these amendments to the Communications and Multimedia Act and the MCMC Act marks a crucial development in Malaysia's efforts to fight online threats, improve <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/what-is-cybersecurity/\" title=\"cybersecurity\">cybersecurity</a>, and regulate the digital space effectively. Fahmi Fadzil and the MADANI Government are taking decisive steps to ensure that Malaysia's digital ecosystem is secure and ready to face the challenges of the future.</span><span>\u00a0</span>",

In a statement, Clipper confirmed, \"There have been third-party claims suggesting a private key leak; however, we can confirm that this is not the case and is inconsistent with the design and <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/\" title=\"security\">security</a> architecture of Clipper.\"\u00a0</span><span>\u00a0</span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_99300\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<img alt=\"Clipper Cyberattack\u00a0\" class=\"size-full wp-image-99300\" height=\"707\" src=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/Clipper-Cyberattack-.webp\" width=\"600\" /> Clipper DEX shares details into the Incident (Source: Clipper DEX on X)[/caption]\n\n<span>The statement emphasized that Clipper\u2019s architecture remains secure. The root cause of the <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/cyberattack/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"cyberattack\">cyberattack</a> was a vulnerability in the withdrawal feature, specifically a bundled swap-and-withdraw function.

        "description": "<p><img alt=\"Holiday season\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/Holiday-Season.webp\" title=\"Tis the Season for Scammers: How to Stay Cyber Safe This Holiday 20\" width=\"1280\" /></p>The holiday season is a time for joy, celebration, and giving. But unfortunately, it\u2019s also the favorite season for scammers, who use it as an opportunity to trick unsuspecting shoppers. As we scroll through endless online deals, discounts, and charitable donation requests, we must remain vigilant. Cybercriminals often use convincing tactics like <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-phishing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"phishing\">phishing</a> emails, fake online stores, and malicious links to steal money, personal data, or even entire identities.\n\nThe reality of this problem is startling. <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/shop-safely-online-holiday-season-tips-secure-our-world\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to the FBI</a>, nearly 12,000 people fell victim to holiday shopping scams in 2022, losing a staggering $73 million. But don\u2019t let that ruin your festive spirit\u2014there are simple, effective steps you can take to protect yourself, your loved ones, and your business during this busy season.\n<h3>The Rise of Holiday Season Scams</h3>\nHoliday scams often begin with enticing messages\u2014perhaps a deal too good to be true, or an urgent charity appeal that tugs at your heartstrings. Scammers craft these messages to look authentic, hoping you\u2019ll click a link or share sensitive information. Once you do, <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/what-is-malware/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"malware\">malware</a> could infect your device, or you might end up handing over your credit card details to a fake website.\n\nThe stakes are high, but the good news is that staying safe is entirely possible. Organizations like <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cisa-cybersecurity-awareness-month/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Secure Our World </a>and <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cisa-learning-platform-boost-skills/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CISA</a> (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) offer valuable tips to arm yourself against these scams.\n<h3>Before You Shop: Strengthen Your Defenses</h3>\nA little preparation goes a long way in protecting your devices and accounts from <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/cyber-news/\" title=\"cyber\">cyber</a> threats. Start with these essential steps:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Keep Your Software Updated</strong>\nEnsure your devices are running the latest software versions. <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/september-2024-patch-tuesday/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Updates</a> often include patches for vulnerabilities that scammers could exploit.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Use Strong Passwords</strong>\nCreate <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/steps-to-create-unbreakable-passwords/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">passwords</a> that are at least 16 characters long, random, and unique for each account. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple platforms.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Leverage a Password Manager</strong>\nA <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/top-password-managers-for-digital-safety/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">password manager</a> not only generates strong passwords but also securely stores and autofills them, saving you time and effort.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Enable Multifactor Authentication (MFA)</strong>\n<a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/phishing-attacks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MFA</a> adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text code or biometric scan, making it harder for scammers to access your accounts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Spotting Phishing Scams: Don\u2019t Take the Bait</h3>\nDuring the holiday rush, <a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/simple-tips-identify-prevent-phishing-scams/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">phishing scams</a> are more frequent\u2014and advanced\u2014than ever. These scams often appear as emails or text messages from what seem to be legitimate retailers. Here\u2019s how to steer clear of the phish hook:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Examine Messages Carefully</strong>\nIf an email or text seems off, trust your instincts. Scammers are experts at mimicking well-known companies, but there are often small signs, like typos or unusual sender addresses, that give them away.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Avoid Clicking Suspicious Links</strong>\nHover over links to see where they lead before clicking. If you\u2019re unsure, go directly to the company\u2019s website through your browser.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Watch Out for Information Requests</strong>\nBe cautious of emails asking for sensitive information like delivery addresses or payment details. Legitimate companies rarely request such information over email.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Report and Delete Suspicious Emails</strong>\nMost email platforms allow you to report phishing attempts. Doing so helps protect not only you but also other users.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Shopping Smart: Tips for Safe Purchases</h3>\n<a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/safe-online-shopping-guide/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Shopping online</a> doesn\u2019t have to be a gamble if you follow a few safety precautions. Here are CISA\u2019s top recommendations for buying with confidence this holiday season:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Stick to Reputable Vendors</strong>\nChoose trusted retailers with secure websites. Look for \u201chttps\u201d in the URL and a padlock symbol in the address bar, which indicate your information is encrypted.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Research Before You Buy</strong>\nA quick web search for reviews or ratings can reveal whether a business is legitimate. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Use Credit Cards Instead of Debit Cards</strong>\nCredit cards offer better protection against unauthorized transactions, allowing you to dispute charges more easily if something goes wrong.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Monitor Your Accounts Regularly</strong>\nCheck your bank and credit card statements frequently during the holiday to catch and report unauthorized charges quickly.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Share the Knowledge</h3>\nThe holidays are about spreading joy, and that includes sharing tips to help others stay safe. Educate your family and friends about the dangers of holiday scams and the simple steps they can take to protect themselves.\n\n<a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/\" title=\"Cybersecurity\">Cybersecurity</a> isn\u2019t just an individual effort\u2014it\u2019s a collective responsibility. By staying informed and vigilant, we can all contribute to a safer online world.\n<h3>A Season of Giving, Not Taking</h3>\nWhile the holiday season brings out the best in many, it also attracts those looking to <a class=\"wpil_keyword_link\" href=\"https://cyble.com/exploit/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"exploit\">exploit</a> our generosity and excitement. But armed with these tips, you can shop, give, and celebrate with confidence, knowing you\u2019ve taken steps to safeguard your digital presence.\n\nLet\u2019s make this holiday season about sharing love and kindness, not falling victim to scams. After all, staying secure is one of the best gifts we can give ourselves and each other.",

The voting kiosk and protocol transmit votes over the internet and then transmit voter-verifiable paper ballots through the mail. In the MERGE protocol, the votes transmitted over the internet are used to tabulate the results and determine the winners, but audits and recounts use the paper ballots that arrive in time. The enunciated motivation for the protocol is to allow (electronic) votes from overseas military voters to be included in preliminary results before a (paper) ballot is received from the voter. MERGE contains interesting ideas that are not inherently unsound; but to make the system trustworthy&#8212;to apply the MERGE protocol&#8212;would require major changes to the laws, practices, and technical and logistical abilities of U.S. election jurisdictions. The gap between theory and practice is large and unbridgeable for the foreseeable future. Promoters of this research project at DARPA, the agency that sponsored the research, should acknowledge that MERGE is internet voting (election results rely on votes transmitted over the internet except in the event of a full hand count) and refrain from claiming that it could be a component of trustworthy elections without sweeping changes to election law and election administration throughout the U.S...</p></blockquote>",
